      "Faction Abilities": "• ZEAL - You always vote first during the agenda phase. When you cast at least 1 vote, cast 1 additional vote for each player in the game including you. • RAID FORMATION - When 1 or more of your units uses ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, for each hit produced in excess of your opponent's Fighters, choose 1 of your opponent's ships that has SUSTAIN DAMAGE to become damaged. Note: The “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step can occur even if a player’s opponent has no fighters in the combat (in this case all hits produced from Anti-Fighter Barrage may cause opposing ships with Sustain Damage to become damaged)",
      "FAQ": "Q: Can ships damaged by Raid Formation trigger a window for the Direct Hit Action card? A: No, Raid Formation does not cause the ship to use its Sustain Damage ability, it only causes it to become damaged, so there is no window for Direct Hit to be used. Q: Can the Argent Flight Hero \"Mirik Aun Sissiri\" be used to move ships into a Supernova or Nebula tile? A: No. Any units moving into, through or out of anomalies must follow the same rules for ships moving into, through or out of anomalies. Q: When is Raid Formation applied? After rolling or after assigning hits? (Interacts with Waylay) A: Raid formation is applied after rolling, before canceling or assigning hits. Q: Does Strike Wing Alpha II infantry killing get prevented by Shields Holding/re-roll abilities? A: The rolls from Strike Wing Alpha II can be subject to rerolls before the ability is applied, but the infantry would be destroyed BEFORE any cancellation of hits. v · d · eFactions and RacesFourth ion ● Third ion ● Second ion ● First ionFourth ionBase GameThe Arborec ● The Barony of Letnev ● The Clan of Saar ● The Embers of Muaat ● The Emirates of Hacan ● The Federation of Sol ● The Ghosts of Creuss ● The L1Z1X Mindnet ● The Mentak Coalition ● The Naalu Collective ● The Nekro Virus ● Sardakk N'orr ● The Universities of Jol-Nar ● The Winnu ● The Xxcha Kingdom ● The Yin Brotherhood ● The Yssaril TribesProphecy of Kings ExpansionThe Argent Flight ● The Empyrean ● The Mahact Gene-Sorcerers ● The Naaz-Rokha Alliance ● The Nomad ● The Titans of Ul ● The Vuil'Raith CabalCodexThe Council KeleresThird ionBase GameThe Barony of Letnev ● The Emirates of Hacan ● The Federation of Sol ● The L1Z1X Mindnet ● The Mentak Coalition ● The Naalu Collective ● Sardakk N'orr ● The Universities of Jol-Nar ● The Xxcha Kingdom ● The Yssaril TribesShattered Empire ExpansionThe Clan of Saar ● The Embers of Muaat ● The Winnu ● The Yin BrotherhoodShards of the Throne ExpansionThe Arborec ● The Ghosts of Creuss ● The Nekro Virus ● The LazaxFaction AttributesGameplayFaction Abilities ● Faction Promissory Notes ● Faction Technologies ● Faction Specific Units ● Flagships ● Faction Starting Fleets ● Faction Starting Technology ● Faction Home Systems ● List of Factions by Play ComplexityLoreFaction Government and Leadership ● Faction Disposition‎ ● List of Factions by Home System Population ● List of Factions by Tendencies ● Faction Colors",

AETHERPASSAGE - After a player activates a system, you may allow that player to move their ships through systems that contain your ships. DARK WHISPERS - During setup, take the additional Empyrean faction promissory note; you have 2 faction promissory notes. When you give a number of commodities to the Empyrean player equal to your maximum commodity value, you each gain 1 trade good. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Empyrean player's units, return this card to the Empyrean player. When you and the Empyrean player cast votes for the same outcome, cast 4 additional votes for that outcome. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Empyrean player's units, return this card to the Empyrean player. After you or one of your neighbors activates a system that is adjacent to an anomaly, you may apply +1 to the move value of all of that player's ships during this tactical action. After a player moves ships into a system that contains 1 or more of your units, they must give you 1 promissory note from their hand, if able. After any player's unit in this system or an adjacent system uses SUSTAIN DAMAGE, you may spend 2 influence to repair that unit. You may exhaust this card; that player gains 1 command token. ACTION: Place 1 frontier token in each system that does not contain any planets and does not already have a frontier token. Then, explore each frontier token that is in a system that contains 1 or more of your ships. Then, purge this card. Q: When a player gives you their commodities and triggers Dark Pact, do you gain all the trade goods simultaneously or the Dark Pact TG separately? (For the purposes of Pillage) A: It is a single gain of commodities and 1 TG simultaneously. Q:: Can the Empyrean flagship be used to repair the same ship, multiple times in the same combat round? Can it spend a 4 influence planet to use the ability twice? A: The Dynamo’s ability can be used multiple times in the same combat round by spending 2 influence, individually, each time.

      "FAQ": "Q: Can you use the Mahact Agent, Jae Mir Kan, to place a token using the secondary of the Construction Strategy Card without placing a structure A: The system that you place a token in must have an eligible planet for you to put a structure on. Q: If the Mahact player has a token where they want to place a structure using another player's token, does the other player's token go in the system or to their reinforcements? A: The other players token is still placed in the system. Q: In regards to the Mahact Commander, Il Na Viroset, when does your turn end? Do you resolve when/after you activate a system abilities? Is this different from Nullification Field or Starlancer? Can you resolve end of your turn abilities? A: Contrary to a previous Twitter ruling, when/after you activate and other abilities within your turn cannot be used when the Mahact player places a second token in a system. End of turn abilities can still be used. Any ability that ends your turn should be treated as ending your turn when they occur, and no further abilities during that same trigger window can take place. Q: What's the interaction with the Mahact Commander, Il Na Viroset, and the Counterstroke action card? A: Counterstroke cannot be played. Q: Does Dark Energy Tap trigger if you used the Mahact Commander, Il Na Viroset? Q: Do ships roll when moving out of a gravity rift due to the Mahact Hero, Benediction? Q: When the Mahact hero, Benediction, is used who is considered the attacker and who is the defender? For ability purposes, is the combat system considered “The Active System”? A: The ships being moved belong to the \"attacker\" and the ships not being moved belong to the \"defender.” The combat system is treated as the active system during that combat. Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, is capacity resolved after moving ships before the space combat? (Only relevant if moving fighters away from a space dock) A: A Capacity check is resolved before the space combat begins. Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, can the Mahact player transport other players' ground forces from planets? Can the units’ owner transport ground forces from planets? A: No in both circumstances. Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, can the Mahact player transport their own ground forces from planets when moving? Q: When using the Mahact Hero, Benediction, if another player's fleet is moved into a Mahact fleet, who is the attacker/defender? A: The player that is moved is the attacker, the player that is moved into is the defender. Q: Can Mahact use their mech ability on themselves? Q: If you are the Mahact player, what happens when an agenda tells you to “remove one of your command tokens from your fleet pool and return it to your reinforcements” but you only have tokens from other players in your fleet pool? A: You are required to remove another player’s token and return it to that player’s reinforcements. Q: If the law Fleet Regulations is in play, and Mahact already has 4 tokens in fleet, can they add another one and then discard one via Edict, or can they NOT add one after a combat win because of the “cannot” in Fleet Regulations? A: The Mahact player can add a 5th token and choose one to return to their reinforcements from their fleet pool afterward. Q: Can a player with 0 votes be targeted by Genetic Recombination? It is theoretically possible for someone to receive abilities via transaction to allow them to vote after the timing window of Genetic Recombination. Is there a defined difference between “cannot vote” and “currently has no votes” for the purposes of this technology? A: Genetic Recombination happens before a player would exhaust planets to vote. So if a player cannot vote, or does not have votes to cast, they cannot be targeted by the tech. If they obtain an ability that would allow them to vote, they could be targeted by the tech before the votes are cast. Q: If Mahact has an Arborec Command Token in their fleet pool, after another player activates an appropriate system that does not already contain a Mahact Mech, can the Mahact player produce a mech and then trigger that mech's ability to end a player’s turn? A: No, the mech was not in the system at the time of activation, so it didn't see the trigger for its ability. Q: If Mahact is in an Alliance game does their ally gain access to Il Na Viroset, the Mahact commander? A: No, Mahact has a special Alliance card that requires their ally to put a Command Token into the Mahact Player's fleet pool. So Mahact gains access to their ally's commander, but their ally does not gain access to the Mahact Commander. \"During setup, you must place one of your command tokens in the Mahact player’s fleet pool; this token cannot be discarded or spent.\". v · d · eFactions and RacesFourth ion ● Third ion ● Second ion ● First ionFourth ionBase GameThe Arborec ● The Barony of Letnev ● The Clan of Saar ● The Embers of Muaat ● The Emirates of Hacan ● The Federation of Sol ● The Ghosts of Creuss ● The L1Z1X Mindnet ● The Mentak Coalition ● The Naalu Collective ● The Nekro Virus ● Sardakk N'orr ● The Universities of Jol-Nar ● The Winnu ● The Xxcha Kingdom ● The Yin Brotherhood ● The Yssaril TribesProphecy of Kings ExpansionThe Argent Flight ● The Empyrean ● The Mahact Gene-Sorcerers ● The Naaz-Rokha Alliance ● The Nomad ● The Titans of Ul ● The Vuil'Raith CabalCodexThe Council KeleresThird ionBase GameThe Barony of Letnev ● The Emirates of Hacan ● The Federation of Sol ● The L1Z1X Mindnet ● The Mentak Coalition ● The Naalu Collective ● Sardakk N'orr ● The Universities of Jol-Nar ● The Xxcha Kingdom ● The Yssaril TribesShattered Empire ExpansionThe Clan of Saar ● The Embers of Muaat ● The Winnu ● The Yin BrotherhoodShards of the Throne ExpansionThe Arborec ● The Ghosts of Creuss ● The Nekro Virus ● The LazaxFaction AttributesGameplayFaction Abilities ● Faction Promissory Notes ● Faction Technologies ● Faction Specific Units ● Flagships ● Faction Starting Fleets ● Faction Starting Technology ● Faction Home Systems ● List of Factions by Play ComplexityLoreFaction Government and Leadership ● Faction Disposition‎ ● List of Factions by Home System Population ● List of Factions by Tendencies ● Faction Colors",

Trivia According to Dane Beltrami[1], the Nomad claims to come from the future, despite their faction sheet never explicitly stating this. The following factors point to this being true: Their emergence shortly after and deep interest in the Acheron disaster. Quickly gaining recognition out of no where with seemingly infinite wealth and resources. Having an agent able to revert time. Having an ability called \"Future Sight\". Starting with their flagship. The Nomad was accompanied by The Company, the five characters that make up the Nomad faction's leaders.[1] Artuno the Betrayer is in charge of the Space Station Sumerian at the behest of the Nomad, and answers to the Nomad. [1] The subtitle for the Nomad's hero Ahk-Syl Siven is \"Sole Survivor\", which according to Dane Beltrami[1] is because he is (supposedly) the last living Creuss in the future from which the Nomad comes. Alternatively, it would make sense for him to be the sole survivor of the Creuss expedition to Acheron In the Aug 2020 Reddit AMA, Dane Beltrami confirmed that the Nomad's Flagship, Memoria, is a reference to the penultimate dungeon of Final Fantasy IX. Memoria is Latin for 'Memory' or, specifically, the ability to remember/recall the Arguments of a Discourse.

      "FAQ": "Q: Hel Titans cannot be transported but can they be moved by use of the technology Transit Diodes? A: Since Transit Diodes uses the terms \"remove\" and \"place\" it may be used to move Hel Titans. Q: Can Hel Titans be destroyed by Bombardment? A: Since Hel Titans are treated as ground forces, they may be bombarded; provided the player bombarding has a unit or ability that is capable of bypassing their Planetary Shield ability. Q: If you awaken a sleeper token or deploy your flagship and then your turn ends (Mahact mech, Nullification field, Minister of Peace), do you resolve combat? A: Coalescence forces combat steps to occur. No other steps of the tactical action occur, and abilities can only be used within combat. Q: If Titans of Ul have their commander, Tungstantus, unlocked and have 2 TGs and go to production to gain a third and build a carrier, is that TG able to be pillaged?

A: Yes, when Terraform is attached to a planet it counts as being in that planet owner’s play area Q: Does LRR 74.5 (2 PDS on a planet max) mean that Titans couldn't commit Hel-Titans using the Sardakk commander, or place a PDS via Sleeper token onto a planet where another player already has 2 PDS? Related, if a planet has 2 PDS on it already can you DEPLOY the Titan’s mech there, given that the mech is \"when you would place a PDS\"? A: LRR 74.5 does not prevent Titans from deploying a PDS. You cannot place a structure on a planet with the maximum number of your structures, which prevents using the DEPLOY ability on a planet with 2 PDS, or placing more PDS than would be allowed using Transit Diodes. You also cannot DEPLOY a mech if you have no PDS in reinforcements, but could remove a PDS from the board and then DEPLOY your mech. Q: If the Titans Agent is used to cancel the only hit “when” it is generated against a player that has Valkyrie Particle Weave as a technology, does VPW trigger? A: The Titan’s Agent will receive an errata to have the same timing as Shields Holding or Sustain Damage. “Before you assign a hit”. The hit is still produced, VPW triggers, then the hit is canceled. Q: Can the Titans Hel-Titan move via abilities like the action card Ghost Squad or via the Sardakk N’orr Alliance?

AWAKEN: After you activate a system that contains 1 or more of your sleeper tokens, you may replace each of those tokens with 1 PDS from your reinforcements. COALESCENCE: If your flagship or your AWAKEN faction ability places your units into the same space area or onto the same planet as another player's units, your units must participate in combat during \"Space Combat\" or \"Ground Combat\" steps. ACTION: Attach this card to a non-home planet you control other than Mecatol Rex. Its resource and influence values are each increased by 1 and it is treated as having all 3 planet traits (Cultural, Hazardous, and Industrial). This unit is treated as both a structure and a ground force. It cannot be transported. This unit is treated as both a structure and a ground force. It cannot be transported. You may use this unit's SPACE CANNON against ships that are adjacent to this unit's system. DEPLOY: After you activate a system that contains 1 or more of your PDS, you may replace 1 of those PDS with this unit. ACTION: Ready Elysium and attach this card to it. Its resource and influence values are each increased by 3, and it gains the SPACE CANNON 5 (x3) ability as if it were a unit. Q: Hel Titans cannot be transported but can they be moved by use of the technology Transit Diodes? A: Since Transit Diodes uses the terms \"remove\" and \"place\" it may be used to move Hel Titans. A: Since Hel Titans are treated as ground forces, they may be bombarded; provided the player bombarding has a unit or ability that is capable of bypassing their Planetary Shield ability. Q: If you awaken a sleeper token or deploy your flagship and then your turn ends (Mahact mech, Nullification field, Minister of Peace), do you resolve combat? A: Coalescence forces combat steps to occur. No other steps of the tactical action occur, and abilities can only be used within combat. Q: If Titans of Ul have their commander, Tungstantus, unlocked and have 2 TGs and go to production to gain a third and build a carrier, is that TG able to be pillaged? A: The gain and spend are simultaneous, so cannot be pillaged Q: Does the Titans of Ul promissory note “Terraform” count for the purposes of objectives like “Strengthen Bonds” or “Betray a Friend”? A: Yes, when Terraform is attached to a planet it counts as being in that planet owner’s play area Q: Does LRR 74.5 (2 PDS on a planet max) mean that Titans couldn't commit Hel-Titans using the Sardakk commander, or place a PDS via Sleeper token onto a planet where another player already has 2 PDS? Related, if a planet has 2 PDS on it already can you DEPLOY the Titan’s mech there, given that the mech is \"when you would place a PDS\"? A: LRR 74.5 does not prevent Titans from deploying a PDS. You cannot place a structure on a planet with the maximum number of your structures, which prevents using the DEPLOY ability on a planet with 2 PDS, or placing more PDS than would be allowed using Transit Diodes. You also cannot DEPLOY a mech if you have no PDS in reinforcements, but could remove a PDS from the board and then DEPLOY your mech. Q: If the Titans Agent is used to cancel the only hit “when” it is generated against a player that has Valkyrie Particle Weave as a technology, does VPW trigger? A: The Titan’s Agent will receive an errata to have the same timing as Shields Holding or Sustain Damage. “Before you assign a hit”. The hit is still produced, VPW triggers, then the hit is canceled. Q: Can the Titans Hel-Titan move via abilities like the action card Ghost Squad or via the Sardakk N’orr Alliance? Q: Does the Geoform ability of Ul the progenitor count as an attachment for the purpose of the objective \"Reclaim ancient monuments\"? All Titans of Ul specific units are named after mythological deities. Hel, a legendary being in Norse mythology who resides over Hel and receives the dead. Saturn, an ancient Roman god of generation, dissolution, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. Ouranos (Uranus), one of the primordial deities of Greek mythology who gave birth to the Titans.
