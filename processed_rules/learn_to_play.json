I am the Winnaran keeper of the Custodian Chronicle, and I write this from the ancient Tower of Annals in old Mecatol City. Since inheriting the duties of the chronicle from my father, I have enjoyed the inspiring views of great buildings, ancient towers, and the bright lights of life that stretch into the distance. Yet, like the shadow at my feet, I can never escape or forget the lethally finite borders of this city. Less than a thousand leagues from my tower, great shields protect us from the poisonous dust that is the Sea of Desolation, the terrible wasteland that covers most of the planet. My people, the Winnarans, have kept this city safe for more than three thousand years. Ever since the time of the Great Scourge, we have been the caretakers of the Imperial Throne, the Imperial Records, and the Galactic Council here on Mecatol Rex. We have indeed been faithful to the promise that we made to the last Emperor. My hands tremble as I write this, for events are now unfolding which I believe to be the harbinger of great change. I foresee that our custodianship will come to an end in my lifetime. This is why I have contacted you. I will seek to give you a brief yet true summary of the recent history of our galaxy. I give this to you because I know that you will spread this knowledge far and wide. As we enter the dangerous years before us, I fear that the galaxy shall have great need of the past. It is told that the Lazax Emperors arose from the ashes of the Mahact kings. Little is known of their early ascension, but it is impossible to deny that the Lazax must have been a profoundly intelligent, benevolent, and wise people. After their rise to power, we know that the Lazax chose the central planet of Mecatol Rex as their home world. The year the Lazax first arrived on Mecatol Rex is recorded in the Imperial Chronicle as “first” and marks the beginning of my account. For ages, the borders of the Lazax Empire expanded outward. As inhabited systems were discovered and annexed into the Empire, the Lazax allowed these newfound civilizations to join the Galactic Council: the governing body that represented the needs and voices of the Empire’s people. The Great Races: Xxcha, Hacan, Letnev, Hylar, Human, and N’orr were all represented in the council, as were hundreds of lesser civilizations and independent systems.\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n\n3 Yet, as the years passed, discoveries of new civilizations and planetary systems slowed. Little by little, the mood of the Empire changed as technological and intellectual growth abated. Craving constant advancement, the Great Races began to look to the power of the Lazax and the resources of their neighbors. Greed and ambition grew in the hearts of statesmen and councilors. The once-noble spirit of the Empire turned suspicious and fearful. It is during this time that the first conflicts between the Great Races are recorded in the Imperial Chronicle. The Galactic Council became a seedbed of intrigue, and the turmoil ushered in a time of spies and assassins. First in secret, and later in public, the Great Races began to build their fleets and armies. Many embarked on territorial expansion that extended beyond their original charter. Border strife and resource disputes proliferated, gnawing at the very foundations of the Empire. This was a time of growing darkness known now as the Age of Dusk. Throughout most of this age, the Lazax still held authority without question. Except for a few minor and unsuccessful rebellions, few dared to openly challenge the Emperors. Blinded by millennia of unchallenged rule, the Lazax could not perceive the mounting ambition and discontent that grew around them. As centuries passed, tensions between the Great Races grew deeper, and so did their desire for power and control. In the end, hatred was their only common ground: hatred for the Lazax, Imperial rule, and for the benevolent arrogance of the emperors. A small affair near the Quann Wormhole was the spark that would set the galaxy aflame. Protesting Imperial trade oversight, the Baron of Letnev began a blockade of traffic through the Quann Wormhole. Because the prickly Letnev had often been troublesome, an unconcerned and unhurried Emperor sought to solve the conflict through the Galactic Council. However, the blockade obstructed significant Sol trading activities and prevented vital supplies from reaching a handful of Sol colonies that soon were struck by famine and disease. After nearly eight months of fruitless debate in the Galactic Council, the patience of the Sol Federation ran dry. Without warning, the blockading Letnev ships were attacked and annihilated by a Sol task force acting without Imperial mandate, and the Quann Passage was reopened. Angered by the unilateral militancy of both Letnev and Sol, the Emperor attempted to consolidate his control by issuing the Maandu Edict: a rule which would place all warships under direct Imperial supervision. The Maandu Edict was the stone that shattered the brittle Empire. The Letnev, Sol, and Jol-Nar civilizations announced their immediate withdrawal from the Council, drawing the galaxy into civil war. The Quann Conflict marks the beginning of the Age of Twilight. As civilization fought civilization—as a thousand territorial disputes erupted over a few years—the Lazax desperately sought to hold together their crumbling Empire. Imperial fleets fought across the galaxy, but their power was ultimately stretched too thin. In the seventy-third year of the war, an alliance of Sol, Jol-Nar, and Hacan launched a surprise attack on Mecatol Rex itself. The last Lazax Emperor and his entire family were killed during the first Sol bombardments, and no successor was named. Of all the planets in the galaxy, no planet was more war- torn than Mecatol Rex. Over the course of only a few years, the planet’s ecology was ravaged by bombardments, its population nearly wiped out, and its green fields blasted into a toxic wasteland. After the death of the Emperor and the loss of the throne- world, Imperial control collapsed. The Lazax became hunted across the galaxy in the vengeful wave of murder that is known now as the Great Scourge. Lasting only twenty years, the scourge resulted in the near-complete annihilation of the Lazax race. Until recently, no Lazax had been seen in the galaxy for more than three thousand years. The Twilight Wars continued for centuries, but no race was powerful enough to seize the throne and risk suffering a similar fate as the Emperor. Slowly, the strength of great civilizations failed as their economies crumbled and as knowledge and technology was lost in the destruction and strain of long war. And so the Age of Twilight ended in a slow whisper. The time that followed, now known as the Dark Years, was a period of economic, cultural, and intellectual collapse. The Great Races retreated into their own small, safe areas of space, abandoning what they could no longer hold by force. After several millennia, the Dark Years came to an end, and a calm but uncertain period of rebuilding began. As I write this, the Great Races of the galaxy have regained elements of their former strength. Here on Mecatol Rex, the Galactic Council is growing in influence once more, while civilizations new and old, are re-colonizing the neighboring systems abandoned during the Dark Years. Signs of great change are everywhere. This year, as if walking out of ancient prophecy, the Lazax returned from the darkness of history in a foreboding cybernetic form. To me, their coming is like the first wind of a terrible storm. I feel as if the galaxy is waking—as if an ancient beast stirs from slumber in a dark cave. The day will soon come when a new Empire will rise. For the sake of all, may the new Emperor have not only the power to seize the throne, but the strength to conquer the peace. If not, I fear that a sea of desolation will drown us all.\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n\n4 OBJECT OF THE GAME Throughout a game of Twilight Imperium, players will barter, plot, and wage war upon one another to complete objectives.

QUICK REFERENCE 6 Command Sheets 17 Faction Sheets Humanity was not the first species to travel the stars, but the voracity with which they spread throughout the galaxy surprised even the eldest of the spacefaring races. SOL SYSTEM ✧ ✧Population 16.44 billion ✧ ✧Government Federation ✧ ✧Leadership Juan Salvador Tao ✧ ✧Disposition Determined ✧ ✧Tendencies Expansionist Nestled in the third orbit of the Sol system lies Jord, the ancestral home of the human race. Few planets can rival Jord’s diversity of climates, seasons, and ecology. Much of this wealth is attributed to its enormous moon, which causes dramatic tidal motions in Jord’s oceans, which is thought to be the impetus of its diverse life and weather patterns. Much of Jord’s orbit, as well as its moon, is crowded with stellar traffic from the orbital and lunar space stations. Military ships of the line, bearing the distinctive Sol symbol, are often moored to the bulky military platforms in Jord’s orbit, or to the fleet base Churchill Prima that orbits the reddish fourth planet of the system. The humans themselves represent the most numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy. Since the discovery of the mass-drive, humans have left Jord to explore, and they con- tinue to explore, the distant corners of space. Humans can be found in all corners of the galaxy and seem to demonstrate the greatest variation in intellect and application of skills. Human colonies and settlements can be found everywhere, as can human servants, traders, cartographers, explorers, mercenar- ies, scholars, construction crews, smugglers, scientists, diplo- mats, etc. It is commonly recognized among galactic historians that it has been the diversified skills of the human race that has been the determining factor in avoiding annihilation or extinction. Of the untold billions of humans that dwell across the gal- axy, all of whose ancestors once migrated from the Sol system, most feel no allegiance or kinship to the Sol Federation or the humans of Jord. Some feel a traditional friendship, while a few remain loyal to Sol and its policies. Being the last civilization to be admitted into the imperial council, it is ironic that Sol was the first to openly declare war against the failing empire. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating the minor conflict into the full scale galactic war known as the Twilight Wars. The Sol Federation of Nations is governed by the bi-annually elected High Minister, who has the executive control of the economy, budget, and Sol military. The executive powers of the High Minister are held in check by three distinct governing houses: The House of Law, The House of the People, and The House of Industry. The four governing bodies of the Federa- tion are all centrally located in the massive metropolis of New Moscow, a bustling center of politics, trade, and high culture. The current High Minister, Juan Salvador Tao, is preparing for a new age that he knows is rapidly evolving before him. He is eager to expand the official colonization of Sol once more, especially to the old colonies of Centauri, Gral, and Quann. He knows that the balance of power is shifting and that the uni- verse will soon once again be governed under one empire. The High Minister will make sure that his Federation will prevail during the coming power struggle and inevitable war. Already the Sol fleet awaits his command to strike nearby systems. Soon the human destiny will be fulfilled, and the distant suns theirs to command.

There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures. Ships Ships represent spacefaring units. Players use these units to engage one another in space combat and expand their empires to new systems. Ground Forces Ground forces represent foot soldiers. Players use these units to invade planets or defend their own territories. Structures Structures represent military installations built by an empire to support its war effort. Reinforcements A player’s personal supply of unused units and unused command tokens is his reinforcements. When producing units and gaining command tokens during the game, players will take those components from their reinforcements. Infantry Space Dock PDS KEY CONCEPT: SYSTEMS AND PLANETS The game board for Twilight Imperium is formed using modular system tiles. Each tile represents a single system in the galaxy, which may contain one or more planets or other celestial bodies. Placing Units on System Tiles When a unit is placed in a system, it is placed in one of two areas on the tile. Structures and ground forces are usually placed on planets, while ships are placed in space—the star-filled area surrounding the planets. Planets As players move about the galaxy and expand their empire beyond their home systems, they will gain control of new planets. When a player gains control of a planet, he takes that planet’s card from either the deck of planet cards or from the player who controlled it previously and places it facedown in his play area. Each planet card displays two values: resources on the left in yellow and influence on the right in blue. Players spend resources to acquire new units and technologies. Players spend influence to gain command tokens and to vote during the agenda phase. If a player ever controls a planet, but has no units on that planet, he places one of the control tokens that matches his faction on that planet to mark that he controls it. Ships are placed in space. Structures and ground forces are placed on planets.

First-time players may not know which strategy card to choose and should consult the strategy card overviews at the bottom of this page and the next. Beginning with the speaker and continuing clockwise, each player chooses one of the strategy cards from the common play area and places it faceup near his faction sheet. After a player chooses a strategy card, it is not available for other players during this game round. Each strategy card has a number between “1” and “8” in the upper-right corner. During the action phase, players take turns in order according to the number printed on their chosen strategy card, starting with “1.” This is called initiative order. After each player has chosen a strategy card, the speaker places one trade good on each strategy card that was not chosen. During future strategy phases, when a player chooses a strategy card that has one or more trade goods on it, he gains those trade goods. PLAYING THE GAME Twilight Imperium is played over a series of game rounds, each of which contains the following four phases that players must resolve in order. 1. STRATEGY PHASE: During this phase, each player chooses a strategy card. These cards provide players with powerful abilities to use during the action phase. Each card also has a number that determines turn order for the game round. 2. ACTION PHASE: During this phase, the majority of the game’s action occurs. This includes moving units, producing units, resolving combat, and using strategy cards. 3. STATUS PHASE: During this phase, players perform cleanup steps in preparation for the next game round. 4. AGENDA PHASE: During this phase, players vote on political agendas, which can have lasting ramifications in the game. The agenda phase is added to the game after a player gains control of Mecatol Rex. These phases repeat in successive game rounds until one player accumulates 10 victory points and wins the game. These phases are described in detail in the following sections. STRATEGY CARD OVERVIEW 1. Leadership: A player might choose this card to gain more command tokens, enabling him to perform more actions during the action phase. 2. Diplomacy: A player might choose this card if he feels threatened, to prevent other players from attacking his system. 3. Politics: A player might choose this card to draw action cards, increasing the variety of abilities that are available to him. 4. Construction: A player might choose this card to produce planetary structures, such as space docks and PDS units. 1 CONDARY ABILIT SECONDARY ABILITY: SECONDARY ABILITY: ✦pend any Spend any amount o ga of inﬂ uence to gain 1 command token 3 inﬂ uence for every 3 inﬂ uence spent.

C POLITICS POLITICS\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n\n9 To understand a tactical action, players need to understand many other game concepts, such as movement and combat. For this reason, the steps of a tactical action are summarized below, but are not described in detail until later. 1. ACTIVATION: The active player must activate a system by taking a command token from his tactic pool and placing it in that system. 2. MOVEMENT: The active player may move ships into a system from any number of other systems. Ships can also transport ground forces from one system to another. 3. SPACE COMBAT: If multiple players have ships in the active system, they resolve a space combat. 4. INVASION: The active player may commit ground forces to land on planets in the active system. If another player has units on those planets, the players resolve a ground combat. 5. PRODUCTION: If the active player has a space dock in the active system, he can produce units by spending resources. A player might not resolve all of the above steps during every tactical action. For example, a player may choose not to move units during the “Movement” step but may still produce units during the “Production” step. ACTION PHASE The action phase is the main phase of the game, during which players produce units, move ships, enact strategies, and interact with other players. During the action phase, players take turns in initiative order. While a player is taking a turn, he is the active player, and he can perform one action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. Initiative order may repeat in this manner several times within a single action phase. The action phase does not end until each player has passed (see below). There are three types of actions: tactical actions, strategic actions, and component actions. They are described in detail later. If a player does not wish to perform an action during his turn, he may pass. After a player passes, his turn is skipped for the remainder of the action phase. A player cannot pass until he has performed his strategic action, which is explained later. After each player has passed, the game round continues to the status phase. TACTICAL ACTION A tactical action allows a player to move ships, initiate combat, invade planets, produce units, and otherwise interact with the game board. STRATEGY CARD OVERVIEW 5. Trade: A player might choose this card to gain trade goods and commodities, which he could use to produce additional units or trade to other players. 6. Warfare: A player might choose this card to allow some of his ships to move twice, or to build a unit and move it during the same game round. 7. Technology: A player might choose this card to research a new technology that would grant him a new ability or unit upgrade. 8. Imperial: A player might choose this card to draw an additional secret objective, granting him additional routes to victory. 5 CONDARY ABILIT SECONDARY ABILITY: SECONDARY ABILITY: ✦pend 1 to Spend 1 token from poo your strategy pool to replenish commodities.s.

OLOGY OLOGY TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n\n10 KEY CONCEPT: COMMAND SHEET Successfully navigating the action phase in Twilight Imperium requires careful management of command tokens. When a player gains a command token, he places it in any one of three pools: the tactic pool, the fleet pool, or the strategy pool. TACTIC POOL During the action phase, players may spend command tokens from their tactic pool to perform tactical actions. FLEET POOL Players place command tokens in their fleet pool with the ship silhouette faceup. Players do not spend these command tokens like the command tokens in their other pools. Instead, the number of tokens in a player’s fleet pool is the maximum number of ships, excluding fighters, that he can have in each system. If a player ever has more ships in a system than he has tokens in his fleet pool, he must return ships from that system to his reinforcements until the number of ships in that system no longer exceeds the number of tokens in his fleet pool. STRATEGY POOL Most of the secondary abilities on strategy cards require a player to spend a token from his strategy pool to resolve the ability. Players will want to keep tokens in their strategy pool so that they can use the secondary abilities of the other players’ strategy cards. STRATEGIC ACTION Each strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability. When a player performs a strategic action, he resolves the primary ability of his strategy card. After resolving this ability, each other player may resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. The active player cannot resolve the secondary ability of his own strategy card. After each player has had an opportunity to resolve a strategy card’s secondary ability, the active player exhausts that strategy card by flipping it facedown. Players cannot resolve abilities on exhausted strategy cards, but the exhausted cards’ numbers are still used to determine initiative order. A player cannot pass during the action phase unless his strategy card is exhausted. This means that each player must perform a strategic action at some point during the action phase, which guarantees that each other player has an opportunity to resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. A player who has passed during the action phase can still resolve the secondary ability of other players’ strategy cards. COMPONENT ACTIONS A component action is an action that is printed on a game component. Many action cards, faction sheets, and even some technology cards have component actions. Each of these effects is preceded by the word “Action.” Exhausting a Strategy Card 2 CONDARY ABILIT SECONDARY ABILITY: SECONDARY ABILITY: ✦pend 1 to Spend 1 token from your to r strategy pool to ready up to 2 exhausted planets.

REPAIR UNITS: Some units may have been turned on their side during the action phase to mark that they have been damaged. Players repair these units during this step by turning them upright. This is described in detail later. 8. RETURN STRATEGY CARDS: Each player returns his strategy card to the common play area. Then, if the custodians token is no longer on Mecatol Rex (the planet in the center of the game board) the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase. AGENDA PHASE After the custodians token has been removed from Mecatol Rex, a new phase is added to each round for the remainder of the game: the agenda phase. During this phase, the galactic council convenes to discuss issues that affect the entire galaxy. Players vote for outcomes on two agendas, establishing laws and policies that have lasting repercussions. Voting on agendas is described in detail later. After resolving this phase, a new game round begins with the strategy phase. If there is no custodians token, players proceed to the agenda phase. 6 1 MECATOL REX 6 1 MECATOL REX The custodians token indicates that players begin a new game round. STATUS PHASE During the status phase, players perform various upkeep tasks, including repairing units and scoring objectives. To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps in order: 1. SCORE OBJECTIVES: In initiative order, each player may score up to one public and one secret objective if he fulfills those cards’ requirements. This is the main way in which players gain the victory points they need to win the game. Objectives are described in detail later. 2. REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE: The speaker flips the next unrevealed public objective card faceup. The first stage II objective is not revealed until all stage I objectives have been revealed. 3. DRAW ACTION CARDS: Each player draws one card from the top of the action card deck. 4. REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player removes all of his command tokens from the game board and returns them to his reinforcements. 5. GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player gains two command tokens from his reinforcements. Then, he may redistribute any of the command tokens on his command sheet by moving them between his tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. 6. READY CARDS: Each player readies all of his exhausted cards, including planet, technology, and strategy cards. KEY CONCEPT: READIED AND EXHAUSTED CARDS Many cards have a readied and an exhausted state. An exhausted card is flipped facedown, indicating that the values and abilities on the front of the card cannot be used. During the status phase, all exhausted cards are readied. A readied card is flipped faceup, indicating that the values and abilities on the front of the card can be used. 4 2 JORD Exhausted Card Distinctly seasonal, with the largest variety of climates and ecologies in the galaxy. The Federation of Sol rules the Jord humans from the great metropolis of New Moscow. 4 2 JORD Readied Card\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n\n12 If an objective’s timing specifies “Action Phase,” a player can score it during the action phase immediately after he fulfills its requirements. Scoring Objectives If a player fulfills an objective’s requirements at the time indicated on the card, he can score it. To do so, he advances his token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the value of the objective card. After scoring an objective, a player places a control token from his supply on that objective card to indicate that he has scored it and cannot score it again this game. If he scored a secret objective, he places the card faceup in front of him before placing a control token on it. Important: Each player can only score one public and one secret objective during each status phase and each step of the action phase. Imperium Rex The game can end early if no player has scored 10 victory points and there are no more objectives to reveal. When the speaker would reveal an objective but cannot, the game immediately ends and the player with the most victory points wins the game. If there is a tie, the player among the tied players who is earliest in initiative order wins the game. WINNING THE GAME A game of Twilight Imperium immediately ends when one player has gained 10 victory points. Players gain victory points by completing objectives. There are two types of objectives: ✦ ✦PUBLIC OBJECTIVES: During setup, the speaker reveals two public objectives, and more are revealed throughout the game. Any number of players can score each of these objectives. Important: A player cannot score public objectives if he does not control all of the planets in his home system. ✦ ✦SECRET OBJECTIVES: Each player begins the game with one secret objective that he may look at but must keep hidden from other players. A player can score his own secret objectives but not those belonging to other players. Important: A player cannot have more than three total scored and unscored secret objectives. If he draws a secret objective and has more than three, he must choose one of his unscored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, he shuffles the secret objective deck. Objective Timing Each objective specifies when a player can score it, either during the status phase or during the action phase. This timing is indicated directly below a card’s title. If a player scores an objective during the status phase, he must fulfill the requirement on the card during the “Score Objectives” step of the status phase to score that objective. For example, if an objective states that a player must control six planets outside of his home system, he must control those planets when he scores the objective— having controlled those planets earlier is not sufficient. Players can score some objectives by spending resources, influence, or tokens, as described by the objective card. To score such an objective, a player must pay the specified cost at the time indicated on the card. THREE– AND FOUR–PLAYER GAMES When playing the game with three or four players, players implement the following rules: ✦ ✦THE STRATEGY PHASE: After each player has chosen one strategy card during the strategy phase, players repeat the strategy card selection process until each player has chosen a second strategy card from the available cards. ✦ ✦INITIATIVE ORDER: Each player’s lowest-numbered strategy card is used to determine his placement in initiative order. ✦ ✦PASSING: A player cannot pass during the action phase unless both of his strategy cards are exhausted. Scoring a Two-Point Objective 2 CTORY POINTS VICTORY POINTS VICTORY POINTS e. Spend 16 inﬂ uence. STATUS PHASE MANIPULATE GALACTIC LAW\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n\n13 2. MOVEMENT During the movement step of a tactical action, the active player may choose to move some of his units into the active system. Each ship has a move value printed on its faction sheet. This value indicates how far that ship can travel to reach the active system. For example, a ship with a move value of “1” can only move to adjacent systems. To resolve this step, the player chooses any of his units that can move into the active system and places them in that system. When moving a ship, a player must obey the following rules: ✦ ✦A ship must end its movement in the active system. ✦ ✦A ship cannot pass through a system that contains another player’s ships, excluding fighters. ✦ ✦A player cannot move units out of a system that contains one of his command tokens. Some ships have a capacity value printed on their faction sheets. When such a ship moves, it may transport a number of fighters and ground forces, in any combination, up to the ship’s capacity value. Transported ground forces and fighters move to the active system along with the ship that is transporting them. These units must remain with the ship in the space area, though ground forces may be able to land on planets during the invasion step. The active player’s ships may also pick up and transport ground forces and fighters from systems that they pass through that do not contain any of their command tokens. THE TACTICAL ACTION This section contains detailed rules for performing a tactical action. To perform a tactical action, players follow these steps in order: 1. ACTIVATION 2. MOVEMENT 3. SPACE COMBAT 4. INVASION 5. PRODUCTION These steps are described in detail in the following sections: 1. ACTIVATION The active player must choose one system that he would like to make the focus of his tactical action. He activates that system by taking a command token from his tactic pool and placing it on that system. That system is the active system for the remainder of the tactical action. A player cannot activate a system that already contains one of his command tokens, but he may activate a system that contains other players’ command tokens. A player also cannot activate a system if he does not have any command tokens in his tactic pool. MOVEMENT EXAMPLE The Xxcha player activates the Wellon system [1]. He intends to move his carrier into that system along with two infantry and two fighters [2]. His carrier can move to the system because it has a move of “1” [3]. It can also transport the infantry and fighters because it has a capacity of “4.” The Xxcha player has two other ships that have move values that are great enough to reach the active system. However, his cruiser [4] is in a system that has already been activated and his destroyer [5] cannot move through a system that contains another player’s ship [6]. As such, neither ship can move to the activated Wellon system. 19 2 1 WELLON 27 1 3 STARPOINT 1 1 NEW ALBION 22 1 1 TAR’MANN 50 20 2 2 VEFUT II 6 2 5 1 4 UPGRADE 4 COST 5 COMBAT 1 MOVE 1 CAPACITY 3 COST 9 COMBAT 1 MOVE 4 CAPACITY CARRIER I 1 COST COST FIGHTE 1 3\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n\n14 KEY CONCEPT: CAPACITY The number of fighters and ground forces that a player has in the space area of a system cannot exceed the combined capacity of that player’s ships in that system. For example, if a player has two carriers in a system, each with a capacity of “4,” that player cannot have a combination of more than eight fighters and ground forces in the space area of that system. Ground forces on planets do not count against this limitation. If at any time the number of a player’s fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system exceeds the capacity of his ships in that system, the excess units are destroyed. During combat, a player’s fighters and ground forces can exceed his ships’ capacity, but at the end of the combat, any excess units are destroyed. 3. SPACE COMBAT If multiple players have ships in the active system, they must resolve a space combat in that system. During combat, the active player is the attacker and the other player is the defender. Players resolve space combat by performing the following steps in order: i. ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: Each player’s units can use their “Anti-Fighter Barrage” abilities. ii. ANNOUNCE RETREAT: Either player may choose to announce a retreat. A retreat will not happen immediately; the units will retreat at the end of the combat round. If a player wishes to retreat with any of his ground forces that are on planets in the active system, he must move them from planets to the space area during this step. iii. MAKE COMBAT ROLLS: Each player rolls one die for each ship he has in the active system. If the result of a unit’s die roll is equal to or greater than that unit’s combat value shown on its faction sheet, that roll produces a hit. The total number of hits a player produces will be used in the next step. If a unit’s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls this number of dice instead, potentially producing one hit with each die rolled. iv. ASSIGN HITS: Each player must choose and destroy one of his ships for each hit his opponent produced. A player removes destroyed ships from the game board and places them in his reinforcements. Since players assign hits to their own units, it is a good strategy to assign hits to units that are cheaper to replace. Because of this, fighters are often used as fodder to protect the rest of a player’s ships. WORMHOLES Some system tiles contain wormholes. There are two types of basic wormholes–alpha and beta–as indicated by the wormhole’s symbol. Systems that contain identical wormholes are adjacent to one another for all purposes. ANOMALIES Some system tiles contain anomalies. These systems restrict movement and have special rules governing them. Asteroid Field ✦ ✦A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field. Nebula ✦ ✦A ship cannot move through, but may move into a nebula. ✦ ✦A defender’s ship in a nebula applies +1 to the result of each of its combat rolls. ✦ ✦A ship moving out of a nebula has a move value of 1. Supernova ✦ ✦A ship cannot move through or into a supernova. Gravity Rift ✦ ✦A ship that moves through or out of a gravity rift applies +1 to its move value and then rolls one die; on a result of 1–3, the ship is destroyed. SPACE CANNON OFFENSE After the active player’s ships move into the active system, each player’s units in the active system may use their “Space Cannon” abilities against the active player’s ships in that system. The active player may also use his units’ “Space Cannon” abilities at this time. The “Space Cannon” ability is explained in detail later. Alpha Wormhole Beta Wormhole 41 43 42 44 Gravity Rift Nebula Asteroid Field Supernova Two Burst Icons 5 COMBAT\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n\n15 End of Space Combat If both players have units remaining in the combat at the end of the “Retreat” step, they resolve another round of combat starting with the “Announce Retreat” step. After all units on one or both sides of the combat have been destroyed or have retreated, play proceeds to the invasion step. Some objectives require a player to win a combat; a player has won a space combat if he is the only player with ships remaining in the active system when the combat has ended. 4. INVASION The active player can invade planets in the active system. Players resolve an invasion by performing the following steps in order: i. BOMBARDMENT: If any planets in the active system contain another player’s ground forces, the active player may use the “Bombardment” abilities of any of his units in that system. This may allow the active player to destroy some of the defender’s units before landing ground forces. Bombardment is described in detail later. ii. COMMIT GROUND FORCES: The active player decides which ground forces he wishes to land on planets. To do so, he takes any of his ground forces that are with his ships in the space area of the active system and places each one on the planet he wishes to invade. iii. SPACE CANNON DEFENSE: If another player has a PDS on any of the planets the active player has committed ground forces to, he may be able to destroy some of those ground forces before they land. The “Space Cannon” ability is described in detail later. iv. GROUND COMBAT: If multiple players have ground forces on the same planet, those players resolve a ground combat. Ground combats on multiple planets are resolved in the order of the active player’s choice. Players resolve ground combat over a number of rounds that each consist of two steps, following the same rules as the space combat steps of the same name: 1. Make Combat Rolls 2. Assign Hits After assigning hits, if multiple players have units remaining on the planet, they resolve another round of ground combat starting with the “Make Combat Rolls” step. After all units on one or both sides of the combat have been destroyed, proceed to the next step. v. ESTABLISH CONTROL: The active player gains control of each invaded planet that still contains at least one of his ground forces. When a player gains control of a planet, he gains its corresponding planet card and places it in his play area exhausted. Then, if the planet contains structures that belong to another player, those structures are destroyed. v. RETREAT: If a player announced a retreat during the first step of the combat round, he retreats. To retreat, the player takes all of his ships from the combat and places them in an adjacent system. The chosen system cannot contain ships that belong to another player and must contain either a planet he controls or at least one of his units; otherwise, the player cannot retreat. If the chosen system does not contain one of that player’s command tokens, the player must place one token from his reinforcements in that system when he retreats. SPACE COMBAT EXAMPLE The green player has activated and moved ships into a system that contains the yellow player’s ships [1]. As such, a space combat begins. Both players roll one die for each ship in the space combat [2]. The green player’s roll produces only one hit while the yellow player’s rolls produce two hits. The green player must assign hits to two of his ships. He chooses to destroy two of his fighters. The yellow player must assign a hit to one of his ships. He chooses to destroy one of his cruisers [3]. The next round of combat begins [4]. This round, the green player’s roll produces two hits while the yellow player’s roll produces one hit. The green player assigns a hit and destroys a fighter while the yellow player must assign the hit to his only ship, a cruiser [5]. Since the yellow player has no ships remaining in the combat, the combat ends and the green player wins. 20 2 2 VEFUT II 20 2 2 VEFUT II 2 3 4 5 1\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n\n16 If a player’s space docks are in the same system as another player’s ships, those space docks are blockaded. Blockaded space docks cannot produce ships. They may, however, still produce ground forces. KEY CONCEPT: SPENDING RESOURCES AND INFLUENCE Many effects in Twilight Imperium require a player to spend resources or influence. To spend a planet’s resources or influence, a player exhausts that planet’s planet card. For example, if a player needs to spend two resources to produce units, he can exhaust a planet that has a resource value of “2” or instead exhaust two planets that each have resource values of “1.” The player could exhaust a planet that has more resources, but the excess resources are lost. 5. PRODUCTION The active player can produce units using his space docks in the active system. When a player produces units, he may choose to produce any of the units on his faction sheet by spending resources equal to the chosen unit’s cost. When a unit is produced, the player takes the unit from his reinforcements and places it in the active system. Players always place ships in the space area of the system in which they were produced. Players always place ground forces on the planet that contains the space dock that produced them. When producing multiple units at a time, the cost values of those units are added together to determine the total cost. Each space dock’s “Production” ability has a value that limits the number of units that it can produce during this step. A player cannot produce more units than the combined production values of his units in the active system. If a unit’s cost is accompanied by two icons, such as the cost values of fighters and infantry, the player receives two units for the indicated cost. When producing these units, each individual unit counts against the production limit. When a player wishes to produce a unit but has no units of that type available in his reinforcements, he may remove one of his units of that type from a system that does not contain one of his command tokens on the game board and return it to his reinforcements. When a player produces a fighter or infantry unit, but has none in his reinforcements, he can use fighter or infantry tokens from the supply instead. These tokens function identically to plastic figures of that type; however, they must be accompanied by at least one plastic figure of that type that matches his color. Populated by small arboreal villages, n this planet’s only true urban center is y of Kklaj the royal city of Kklaj. The Xxcha home the royal city of Kklaj. The Xxcha home world and home to the renowned library of Xuun. 3 2 ARCHON REN 3 2 ARCHON REN Influence Resources Two Unit Icons COST 1 PRODUCTION EXAMPLE The Xxcha player activates his home system [1]. He will be producing units from the space dock located on Archon Tau [2]. He intends to produce one carrier and as many infantry as he can afford. His space dock has a production value of “3,” meaning that it can produce up to three units. The cost of a carrier is three resources, and the cost of two infantry is one resource [3], so he will need to exhaust at least four resources total to produce them. After exhausting both of his planet cards, he is still one resource short, so he must spend one trade good (detailed on the following page). Then, he places two infantry [4] on Archon Tau and one carrier [5] in the space area of that system tile. 14 ARCHON TAU 1 1 ARCHON REN 3 2 1 2 Ravaged by Sol and Letnev e bombardments during the Twilight Xxcha com Wars.

Players are encouraged to replenish commodities through the “Trade” strategy card and trade them to one another in mutually beneficial transactions. NEIGHBORS, TRANSACTIONS, AND DEALS As players move their ships about the galaxy and invade planets, they will undoubtedly come into contact with other players’ empires. While this may often lead to war over planets and systems, it does not have to. Neighboring players can peacefully trade with each other. If a player has a unit or controls a planet in a system that is adjacent to a system that contains a unit or planet that another player controls, those two players are neighbors. During the active player’s turn, he may negotiate a transaction with one or more of his neighbors, even during a combat. As part of a transaction, the negotiating players may exchange any number of trade goods and commodities. The active player may negotiate only once with each of his neighbors per turn. After a transaction has been finalized, no other transactions may occur between those players that turn. Frequently, players will negotiate transactions that go beyond a simple exchange of goods. These transactions are called deals. For example, the active player might move his ships into a system that contains another player’s PDS, at which point the active player might offer the owner of that PDS a trade good to refrain from using the “Space Cannon” ability. Because the effect can be resolved immediately, this deal is a binding deal. When a deal is binding, a player must honor his end of the bargain. In the previous example, if the owner of the PDS agrees to this deal and takes the trade good, he cannot fire his PDS as this would violate their agreement. Not all deals are binding, however. For example, a player might offer another player a trade good to attack a specific player during a later turn. Because the effect cannot be resolved immediately, this deal is a non-binding deal. The player who was given the trade good, despite the terms of the deal, is not required to honor his end of the bargain and may fulfill or ignore the deal as he chooses. The red player is a neighbor to both the blue player and the Xxcha player. 50 04 1 4 MUAAT 20 2 2 VEFUT II ADDITIONAL RULES This section contains additional rules that players need to understand to play their first game. ACTION CARDS Throughout the game, players will accumulate action cards. Players can use action cards to resolve powerful one-time abilities. Each player can have a maximum of seven action cards in his hand. If a player exceeds this number, he must choose which seven cards he wishes to keep and discard the rest. Each action card indicates when it can be used at the top of its card. When an action card is used, the player using it reveals the card, resolves its effect, and discards the card. If an action card begins with the word “Action,” it can be used as a component action during a player’s turn of the action phase. TRADE GOODS AND COMMODITIES Trade goods are a universal currency that players will use to produce units or bribe other empires. A player may spend a trade good as either one resource or one influence. Players may also accumulate commodities. A commodity represents a product that is plentiful within a player’s empire. Commodities have no inherent value but become trade goods when given to another player. Both trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite sides of the same token, and exist in values of “1” or “3.” During the game, players may replenish commodities by using the abilities of the “Trade” strategy card. When a player replenishes commodities, he takes commodity tokens from the supply until he has a number of tokens equal to the commodities value on his faction sheet. A player cannot have more commodities than that printed value. RADE RADE 6 This unit’s PRODUCTION value is equal to 2 more than the resource value of this planet. Up to 3 fighters in this system do not count against your ships’capacity.

TRADE TRADE Trade Good Commodity “Trade” Strategy Card Commodities Value\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n\n18 Researching Technology Players gain new technology by researching it, usually by using the “Technology” strategy card. To research a technology, players must satisfy the prerequisites of the technology they wish to research. Prerequisites are printed as a column on the lower-left side of each technology card and contain one or more symbols that correspond to the four basic technology colors. Some technologies have no prerequisites and can be researched without owning any technology. To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, a player must own a matching technology for each prerequisite symbol on the card he wishes to research. For example, a player that owns two red technologies may research the red technology “Duranium Armor,” as it has two red prerequisites. After the player researches the “Duranium Armor” technology, it satisfies another red prerequisite, as indicated on the lower‑right corner of the card; the next time that player researches a technology, he may research a technology that has three red symbols as a prerequisite. Unit upgrade technologies, unlike other technologies, may have prerequisites composed of multiple colors. Additionally, unit upgrade technologies do not satisfy prerequisites when researching technology. Technology Specialties Some planets provide the player with a technology specialty. Technology specialties are extremely valuable and help players research new technologies. If a player controls a planet that has a technology specialty symbol, he may exhaust that planet when researching technology to ignore a prerequisite that matches that technology specialty. While researching technology, players may exhaust planets for their technology specialty or for their resources, but not for both. 31 1 0 LAZAR The only inhabited world in a forgettable system. Few native resources and only rudimentary, often underdeveloped, industries. 0 1 LAZAR TECHNOLOGY During the game, players will gain technology in the form of technology cards. Technologies provide players with powerful abilities and allow players to upgrade their units. Each player has an identical deck of technology cards that he may look through at any time, as well as a number of faction technology cards that he set aside during setup. There are four basic colors of technology. A technology’s color is indicated by a green, red, blue, or yellow symbol located on the lower-right corner of the card. Players use these symbols when researching technology. Each player begins the game with a number of starting technologies as indicated on the back of his faction sheet. Additionally, a player can research new technologies from his deck during the game. A player places his starting technologies and any technology he researches faceup in his play area. After a technology is faceup in a player’s play area, that player owns that technology. A player’s owned technologies remain in play for the duration of the game and their abilities can be used as described on the card. Some technologies have the word “Action” in their card text; players can resolve these cards by using a component action during the action phase. Some technologies are unit upgrade technologies. Unit upgrades technologies match a unit on a player’s faction sheet. When a player gains a unit upgrade technology, he places its card over the corresponding unit on his faction sheet. The white arrows next to an attribute’s value on the faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when its unit is upgraded. When a unit is upgraded, all the player’s units of that type, both on the game board and in his reinforcements, now have the attributes shown on the unit upgrade technology. Red Technology Card When 1 or more of your units use BOMBARDMENT or SPACE CANNON, 1 of those units may roll 1 additional die.

PLASMA SCORING You may exhaust this card at the start of a round of ground combat on a planet that contains 1 or more of your units that have PLANETARY SHIELD; your opponent cannot make combat rolls during this combat round. MAGEN DEFENSE GRID During each combat round, after you assign hits to your units, repair 1 of your damaged units that did not use SUSTAIN DAMAGE during this combat round.

This number indicates how many dice a player rolls. For example, when a player uses an ability that reads “Space Cannon 5 (x3),” he rolls three dice and each die with a result of “5” or higher produces one hit. If an ability that requires a roll does not contain a number inside parentheses, a player only rolls one die. Hits that are produced by abilities are assigned immediately. When a hit is produced against a player’s units, he chooses and destroys one of his units. Players use each of these abilities at different times and can hit different types of units as described below: ✦ ✦ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: A player uses this ability during the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step of the first round of space combat. These hits can only be assigned to fighters. ✦ ✦BOMBARDMENT: A player uses this ability during the “Bombardment” step of an invasion. These hits can only be assigned by the bombarded player to ground forces on the planet being bombarded. If there are multiple planets in the system, the active player must choose which of his units in the system are bombarding which planets before rolling dice. ✦ ✦SPACE CANNON: A player can use this ability at two different times, as follows: ✦ ✦After the “Movement” step of a tactical action, all players can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their units that are in the active system. The player whose units the ability was used against must assign these hits to ships in that system. ✦ ✦During the “Space Cannon Defense” step of an invasion, the player who controls the planet being invaded can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of his units on that planet. The invading player must assign these hits to his ground forces that are invading the planet. PLANET TRAITS Most planets outside of home systems have a planet trait. There are three types of planets: cultural, hazardous, and industrial. Traits have no inherent game effect, but are referred to by some cards and abilities. UNIT ABILITIES Many units in the game have unit abilities that appear as bulleted keywords on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards. The rules for these abilities are as follows: PLANETARY SHIELD If a unit has the “Planetary Shield” ability, the planet where that unit is located is not an eligible target for other units’ “Bombardment” abilities. SUSTAIN DAMAGE If a unit has the “Sustain Damage” ability, it can become damaged to cancel one hit. A damaged unit is turned on its side but otherwise functions as it did previously. A damaged unit cannot use “Sustain Damage” until it is repaired either during the status phase or by another game effect. PRODUCTION A unit with the “Production” ability, such as a space dock, can produce new units. This ability is always followed by a value which dictates the maximum number of units that a unit that has this ability can produce. See “Production” on page 16. OFFENSIVE ABILITIES The following abilities require a player to roll dice to determine whether or not another player’s units are hit: “Anti-Fighter Barrage,” “Bombardment,” and “Space Cannon.” These abilities are always followed by a number that determines the minimum die result required to produce a hit. For example, “Bombardment 5” indicates that the player rolls a single die, and if the result is five or greater, it produces one hit. Cultural Planet Industrial Planet Hazardous Planet Damaged Dreadnought Undamaged Dreadnought\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n\n20 1. FIRST AGENDA To resolve an agenda, players perform the following steps: i. Reveal Agenda The speaker draws one agenda card from the top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to all players, including its possible outcomes. ii. Vote Each player, starting with the player to the left of the speaker and continuing clockwise, casts votes in favor of a single outcome. When it is a player’s turn to cast votes, he may exhaust any number of his planets. Each planet contributes a number of votes equal to its influence value. Outcomes The outcomes that a player can vote for depend upon the type of agenda: ✦ ✦FOR OR AGAINST: The player commits his votes “For” or “Against” the agenda. The agenda card will have different results according to the outcome that receives the most votes. ✦ ✦ELECT PLAYER: The player commits his votes for the player of his choice, including himself. ✦ ✦ELECT PLANET: The player commits his votes for the planet of his choice. That planet must be controlled by a player unless the agenda specifies otherwise. When casting votes, the player announces the outcome he is voting for aloud. For example, a player may say, “I’m casting three votes to elect the Hacan player” or “I’m casting three votes against this agenda.” A player can only vote for one outcome per agenda. For example, he cannot cast votes for two different players. He may, however, choose to abstain from the vote entirely. Transactions During each vote, players may freely negotiate transactions with other players, even if they are not neighbors with those players. Each player may negotiate up to one transaction with each other player while resolving the vote for each agenda. This often involves convincing players to vote for certain outcomes using trade goods or future promises. iii. Resolve Outcome Players count votes and resolve the outcome with the most votes. Each agenda will be one of two types: a directive or a law. Directives When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received the most votes and discard the agenda card immediately. THE GALACTIC COUNCIL This section contains rules for the agenda phase, which is added to the game after a player gains control of Mecatol Rex. The agenda phase involves heavy negotiation and political maneuvering. CUSTODIANS OF MECATOL REX The custodians token represents the caretakers that safeguard Mecatol Rex until one of the great races can claim the throne. Players may freely move units into the Mecatol Rex system, but cannot land ground forces on the planet while the custodians token is present. To remove this token, the active player must spend six influence immediately before landing ground forces on the planet. If the player cannot spend six influence, he cannot land ground forces on the planet. When a player removes the custodians token, he places it in his play area and gains one victory point. Since the galactic council can now convene on Mecatol Rex, the agenda phase is added as the last phase of each game round, including the round during which a player gained control of Mecatol Rex. THE AGENDA PHASE After the agenda phase has been added to the game, the galactic council votes upon issues that affect the entire galaxy. These issues are referred to as agendas and are represented by agenda cards. Each agenda card has text that includes a number of possible outcomes. Each outcome will affect the game, and players will vote for which outcome they want to occur. To resolve the agenda phase, players perform the following steps in order: 1. FIRST AGENDA i. REVEAL AGENDA ii. VOTE iii. RESOLVE OUTCOME 2. SECOND AGENDA i. REVEAL AGENDA ii. VOTE iii. RESOLVE OUTCOME 4. READY PLANETS DIRECTIVE When this agenda is revealed, if there are no laws in play, discard this card and reveal another agenda from the top of the deck. For: Discard all laws from play. At the start of the next strategy phase, each player exhausts each planet in his home system. Against: No eﬀ ect. E NEW CONST CONSTITUTION\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n\n21 ADVANCED RULES After players have played their first game, they should use the advanced rules found in this section. COMPLETE SETUP This booklet contains rules for an abridged “First-Game Setup” to facilitate players’ first time playing the game. During setup for a standard game, players have a wider array of factions to choose from, many of which are more complex than the factions suggested in the “First-Game Setup.” During setup, players are dealt a hand of system tiles to create the galaxy instead of using a preset map. Full rules for setup can be found in the “Complete Setup” section on page 2 of the Rules Reference. Additionally, during setup, players will receive promissory notes, a type of card that players can use to facilitate negotiations with other players. Finally, players who wish to play a longer game may use the 14-space side of the victory point track. PROMISSORY NOTES Each player begins the game with five promissory note cards; four of which match his player color, and one faction-specific card. A promissory note helps players negotiate with each other by creating an enforceable contract between them. A player can offer a promissory note to another player as part of a transaction. Each promissory note contains text that describes the card’s effect and indicates when the card can be resolved. A player cannot resolve his own promissory notes, but he can resolve other players’ notes that he receives from a transaction. When a player resolves a promissory note, he reveals the card and resolves its text effect. Though some promissory notes will stay in play after they are resolved, a promissory note is usually returned to its original owner and may again be offered by that player as part of a transaction. When a player offers a promissory note to another player as part of a transaction, the offering player may allow the receiving player to view the card being offered if he wishes. A player cannot trade more than one promissory note during a single transaction. Players can also exchange promissory notes that they have received from other players. This does not require permission from the promissory note’s original owner. When you receive this card, if you are not the blue player, you must place it faceup in your play area and gain 1 victory point. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the blue player’s units, or if the blue player is eliminated, lose 1 victory point and return this card to the blue player. SUPPORT FOR THE THRONE Laws When resolving a law, if a “For” outcome received the most votes, or if the law requires an election, the law’s effect becomes a permanent part of the game. Players resolve the outcome and place the agenda card in the common play area unless the effect specifies otherwise. If an “Against” outcome received the most votes, players resolve the text effect of the outcome and discard the agenda immediately. Ties If multiple outcomes receive the same number of votes after all players have voted, the speaker decides which of the tied outcomes is resolved. 2. SECOND AGENDA Players resolve a second agenda following the same rules and steps for step 1, “First Agenda.” 3. READY PLANETS Each player readies all of his planet cards. Then, the agenda phase ends and players begin a new game round, starting with the strategy phase. STOP! Now, players know all the rules necessary to play their first game. As questions arise during the game, players are encouraged to consult the Rules Reference for answers regarding the topic in question rather than referring to this Learn To Play booklet. Players that are already familiar with the game should read the rules for complete setup and promissory notes in the next column.

      "text": "2 My name is Mahthom Iq Seerva. I am the Winnaran keeper of the Custodian Chronicle, and I write this from the ancient Tower of Annals in old Mecatol City. Since inheriting the duties of the chronicle from my father, I have enjoyed the inspiring views of great buildings, ancient towers, and the bright lights of life that stretch into the distance. Yet, like the shadow at my feet, I can never escape or forget the lethally finite borders of this city. Less than a thousand leagues from my tower, great shields protect us from the poisonous dust that is the Sea of Desolation, the terrible wasteland that covers most of the planet. My people, the Winnarans, have kept this city safe for more than three thousand years. Ever since the time of the Great Scourge, we have been the caretakers of the Imperial Throne, the Imperial Records, and the Galactic Council here on Mecatol Rex. We have indeed been faithful to the promise that we made to the last Emperor. My hands tremble as I write this, for events are now unfolding which I believe to be the harbinger of great change. I foresee that our custodianship will come to an end in my lifetime. This is why I have contacted you. I will seek to give you a brief yet true summary of the recent history of our galaxy. I give this to you because I know that you will spread this knowledge far and wide. As we enter the dangerous years before us, I fear that the galaxy shall have great need of the past. It is told that the Lazax Emperors arose from the ashes of the Mahact kings. Little is known of their early ascension, but it is impossible to deny that the Lazax must have been a profoundly intelligent, benevolent, and wise people. After their rise to power, we know that the Lazax chose the central planet of Mecatol Rex as their home world. The year the Lazax first arrived on Mecatol Rex is recorded in the Imperial Chronicle as “first” and marks the beginning of my account. For ages, the borders of the Lazax Empire expanded outward. As inhabited systems were discovered and annexed into the Empire, the Lazax allowed these newfound civilizations to join the Galactic Council: the governing body that represented the needs and voices of the Empire’s people. The Great Races: Xxcha, Hacan, Letnev, Hylar, Human, and N’orr were all represented in the council, as were hundreds of lesser civilizations and independent systems."

      "text": "3 Yet, as the years passed, discoveries of new civilizations and planetary systems slowed. Little by little, the mood of the Empire changed as technological and intellectual growth abated. Craving constant advancement, the Great Races began to look to the power of the Lazax and the resources of their neighbors. Greed and ambition grew in the hearts of statesmen and councilors. The once-noble spirit of the Empire turned suspicious and fearful. It is during this time that the first conflicts between the Great Races are recorded in the Imperial Chronicle. The Galactic Council became a seedbed of intrigue, and the turmoil ushered in a time of spies and assassins. First in secret, and later in public, the Great Races began to build their fleets and armies. Many embarked on territorial expansion that extended beyond their original charter. Border strife and resource disputes proliferated, gnawing at the very foundations of the Empire. This was a time of growing darkness known now as the Age of Dusk. Throughout most of this age, the Lazax still held authority without question. Except for a few minor and unsuccessful rebellions, few dared to openly challenge the Emperors. Blinded by millennia of unchallenged rule, the Lazax could not perceive the mounting ambition and discontent that grew around them. As centuries passed, tensions between the Great Races grew deeper, and so did their desire for power and control. In the end, hatred was their only common ground: hatred for the Lazax, Imperial rule, and for the benevolent arrogance of the emperors. A small affair near the Quann Wormhole was the spark that would set the galaxy aflame. Protesting Imperial trade oversight, the Baron of Letnev began a blockade of traffic through the Quann Wormhole. Because the prickly Letnev had often been troublesome, an unconcerned and unhurried Emperor sought to solve the conflict through the Galactic Council. However, the blockade obstructed significant Sol trading activities and prevented vital supplies from reaching a handful of Sol colonies that soon were struck by famine and disease. After nearly eight months of fruitless debate in the Galactic Council, the patience of the Sol Federation ran dry. Without warning, the blockading Letnev ships were attacked and annihilated by a Sol task force acting without Imperial mandate, and the Quann Passage was reopened. Angered by the unilateral militancy of both Letnev and Sol, the Emperor attempted to consolidate his control by issuing the Maandu Edict: a rule which would place all warships under direct Imperial supervision. The Maandu Edict was the stone that shattered the brittle Empire. The Letnev, Sol, and Jol-Nar civilizations announced their immediate withdrawal from the Council, drawing the galaxy into civil war. The Quann Conflict marks the beginning of the Age of Twilight. As civilization fought civilization—as a thousand territorial disputes erupted over a few years—the Lazax desperately sought to hold together their crumbling Empire. Imperial fleets fought across the galaxy, but their power was ultimately stretched too thin. In the seventy-third year of the war, an alliance of Sol, Jol-Nar, and Hacan launched a surprise attack on Mecatol Rex itself. The last Lazax Emperor and his entire family were killed during the first Sol bombardments, and no successor was named. Of all the planets in the galaxy, no planet was more war- torn than Mecatol Rex. Over the course of only a few years, the planet’s ecology was ravaged by bombardments, its population nearly wiped out, and its green fields blasted into a toxic wasteland. After the death of the Emperor and the loss of the throne- world, Imperial control collapsed. The Lazax became hunted across the galaxy in the vengeful wave of murder that is known now as the Great Scourge. Lasting only twenty years, the scourge resulted in the near-complete annihilation of the Lazax race. Until recently, no Lazax had been seen in the galaxy for more than three thousand years. The Twilight Wars continued for centuries, but no race was powerful enough to seize the throne and risk suffering a similar fate as the Emperor. Slowly, the strength of great civilizations failed as their economies crumbled and as knowledge and technology was lost in the destruction and strain of long war. And so the Age of Twilight ended in a slow whisper. The time that followed, now known as the Dark Years, was a period of economic, cultural, and intellectual collapse. The Great Races retreated into their own small, safe areas of space, abandoning what they could no longer hold by force. After several millennia, the Dark Years came to an end, and a calm but uncertain period of rebuilding began. As I write this, the Great Races of the galaxy have regained elements of their former strength. Here on Mecatol Rex, the Galactic Council is growing in influence once more, while civilizations new and old, are re-colonizing the neighboring systems abandoned during the Dark Years. Signs of great change are everywhere. This year, as if walking out of ancient prophecy, the Lazax returned from the darkness of history in a foreboding cybernetic form. To me, their coming is like the first wind of a terrible storm. I feel as if the galaxy is waking—as if an ancient beast stirs from slumber in a dark cave. The day will soon come when a new Empire will rise. For the sake of all, may the new Emperor have not only the power to seize the throne, but the strength to conquer the peace. If not, I fear that a sea of desolation will drown us all."

QUICK REFERENCE 6 Command Sheets 17 Faction Sheets Humanity was not the first species to travel the stars, but the voracity with which they spread throughout the galaxy surprised even the eldest of the spacefaring races. SOL SYSTEM ✧ ✧Population 16.44 billion ✧ ✧Government Federation ✧ ✧Leadership Juan Salvador Tao ✧ ✧Disposition Determined ✧ ✧Tendencies Expansionist Nestled in the third orbit of the Sol system lies Jord, the ancestral home of the human race. Few planets can rival Jord’s diversity of climates, seasons, and ecology. Much of this wealth is attributed to its enormous moon, which causes dramatic tidal motions in Jord’s oceans, which is thought to be the impetus of its diverse life and weather patterns. Much of Jord’s orbit, as well as its moon, is crowded with stellar traffic from the orbital and lunar space stations. Military ships of the line, bearing the distinctive Sol symbol, are often moored to the bulky military platforms in Jord’s orbit, or to the fleet base Churchill Prima that orbits the reddish fourth planet of the system. The humans themselves represent the most numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy. Since the discovery of the mass-drive, humans have left Jord to explore, and they con- tinue to explore, the distant corners of space. Humans can be found in all corners of the galaxy and seem to demonstrate the greatest variation in intellect and application of skills. Human colonies and settlements can be found everywhere, as can human servants, traders, cartographers, explorers, mercenar- ies, scholars, construction crews, smugglers, scientists, diplo- mats, etc. It is commonly recognized among galactic historians that it has been the diversified skills of the human race that has been the determining factor in avoiding annihilation or extinction. Of the untold billions of humans that dwell across the gal- axy, all of whose ancestors once migrated from the Sol system, most feel no allegiance or kinship to the Sol Federation or the humans of Jord. Some feel a traditional friendship, while a few remain loyal to Sol and its policies. Being the last civilization to be admitted into the imperial council, it is ironic that Sol was the first to openly declare war against the failing empire. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating the minor conflict into the full scale galactic war known as the Twilight Wars. The Sol Federation of Nations is governed by the bi-annually elected High Minister, who has the executive control of the economy, budget, and Sol military. The executive powers of the High Minister are held in check by three distinct governing houses: The House of Law, The House of the People, and The House of Industry. The four governing bodies of the Federa- tion are all centrally located in the massive metropolis of New Moscow, a bustling center of politics, trade, and high culture. The current High Minister, Juan Salvador Tao, is preparing for a new age that he knows is rapidly evolving before him. He is eager to expand the official colonization of Sol once more, especially to the old colonies of Centauri, Gral, and Quann. He knows that the balance of power is shifting and that the uni- verse will soon once again be governed under one empire. The High Minister will make sure that his Federation will prevail during the coming power struggle and inevitable war. Already the Sol fleet awaits his command to strike nearby systems. Soon the human destiny will be fulfilled, and the distant suns theirs to command.

      "text": "5 KEY CONCEPT: UNITS During a game of Twilight Imperium, each player’s units are represented by plastic figures. There are three types of units: ships, ground forces, and structures. Ships Ships represent spacefaring units. Players use these units to engage one another in space combat and expand their empires to new systems. Ground Forces Ground forces represent foot soldiers. Players use these units to invade planets or defend their own territories. Structures Structures represent military installations built by an empire to support its war effort. Reinforcements A player’s personal supply of unused units and unused command tokens is his reinforcements. When producing units and gaining command tokens during the game, players will take those components from their reinforcements. Infantry Space Dock PDS KEY CONCEPT: SYSTEMS AND PLANETS The game board for Twilight Imperium is formed using modular system tiles. Each tile represents a single system in the galaxy, which may contain one or more planets or other celestial bodies. Placing Units on System Tiles When a unit is placed in a system, it is placed in one of two areas on the tile. Structures and ground forces are usually placed on planets, while ships are placed in space—the star-filled area surrounding the planets. Planets As players move about the galaxy and expand their empire beyond their home systems, they will gain control of new planets. When a player gains control of a planet, he takes that planet’s card from either the deck of planet cards or from the player who controlled it previously and places it facedown in his play area. Each planet card displays two values: resources on the left in yellow and influence on the right in blue. Players spend resources to acquire new units and technologies. Players spend influence to gain command tokens and to vote during the agenda phase. If a player ever controls a planet, but has no units on that planet, he places one of the control tokens that matches his faction on that planet to mark that he controls it. Ships are placed in space. Structures and ground forces are placed on planets.

      "text": "8 STRATEGY PHASE During the strategy phase, players take turns selecting a strategy card that provides them with a unique action they can use during the action phase. First-time players may not know which strategy card to choose and should consult the strategy card overviews at the bottom of this page and the next. Beginning with the speaker and continuing clockwise, each player chooses one of the strategy cards from the common play area and places it faceup near his faction sheet. After a player chooses a strategy card, it is not available for other players during this game round. Each strategy card has a number between “1” and “8” in the upper-right corner. During the action phase, players take turns in order according to the number printed on their chosen strategy card, starting with “1.” This is called initiative order. After each player has chosen a strategy card, the speaker places one trade good on each strategy card that was not chosen. During future strategy phases, when a player chooses a strategy card that has one or more trade goods on it, he gains those trade goods. PLAYING THE GAME Twilight Imperium is played over a series of game rounds, each of which contains the following four phases that players must resolve in order. 1. STRATEGY PHASE: During this phase, each player chooses a strategy card. These cards provide players with powerful abilities to use during the action phase. Each card also has a number that determines turn order for the game round. 2. ACTION PHASE: During this phase, the majority of the game’s action occurs. This includes moving units, producing units, resolving combat, and using strategy cards. 3. STATUS PHASE: During this phase, players perform cleanup steps in preparation for the next game round. 4. AGENDA PHASE: During this phase, players vote on political agendas, which can have lasting ramifications in the game. The agenda phase is added to the game after a player gains control of Mecatol Rex. These phases repeat in successive game rounds until one player accumulates 10 victory points and wins the game. These phases are described in detail in the following sections. STRATEGY CARD OVERVIEW 1. Leadership: A player might choose this card to gain more command tokens, enabling him to perform more actions during the action phase. 2. Diplomacy: A player might choose this card if he feels threatened, to prevent other players from attacking his system. 3. Politics: A player might choose this card to draw action cards, increasing the variety of abilities that are available to him. 4. Construction: A player might choose this card to produce planetary structures, such as space docks and PDS units. 1 CONDARY ABILIT SECONDARY ABILITY: SECONDARY ABILITY: ✦pend any Spend any amount o ga of inﬂ uence to gain 1 command token 3 inﬂ uence for every 3 inﬂ uence spent.

      "text": "9 To understand a tactical action, players need to understand many other game concepts, such as movement and combat. For this reason, the steps of a tactical action are summarized below, but are not described in detail until later. 1. ACTIVATION: The active player must activate a system by taking a command token from his tactic pool and placing it in that system. 2. MOVEMENT: The active player may move ships into a system from any number of other systems. Ships can also transport ground forces from one system to another. 3. SPACE COMBAT: If multiple players have ships in the active system, they resolve a space combat. 4. INVASION: The active player may commit ground forces to land on planets in the active system. If another player has units on those planets, the players resolve a ground combat. 5. PRODUCTION: If the active player has a space dock in the active system, he can produce units by spending resources. A player might not resolve all of the above steps during every tactical action. For example, a player may choose not to move units during the “Movement” step but may still produce units during the “Production” step. ACTION PHASE The action phase is the main phase of the game, during which players produce units, move ships, enact strategies, and interact with other players. During the action phase, players take turns in initiative order. While a player is taking a turn, he is the active player, and he can perform one action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. Initiative order may repeat in this manner several times within a single action phase. The action phase does not end until each player has passed (see below). There are three types of actions: tactical actions, strategic actions, and component actions. They are described in detail later. If a player does not wish to perform an action during his turn, he may pass. After a player passes, his turn is skipped for the remainder of the action phase. A player cannot pass until he has performed his strategic action, which is explained later. After each player has passed, the game round continues to the status phase. TACTICAL ACTION A tactical action allows a player to move ships, initiate combat, invade planets, produce units, and otherwise interact with the game board. STRATEGY CARD OVERVIEW 5. Trade: A player might choose this card to gain trade goods and commodities, which he could use to produce additional units or trade to other players. 6. Warfare: A player might choose this card to allow some of his ships to move twice, or to build a unit and move it during the same game round. 7. Technology: A player might choose this card to research a new technology that would grant him a new ability or unit upgrade. 8. Imperial: A player might choose this card to draw an additional secret objective, granting him additional routes to victory. 5 CONDARY ABILIT SECONDARY ABILITY: SECONDARY ABILITY: ✦pend 1 to Spend 1 token from poo your strategy pool to replenish commodities.s.

      "text": "10 KEY CONCEPT: COMMAND SHEET Successfully navigating the action phase in Twilight Imperium requires careful management of command tokens. When a player gains a command token, he places it in any one of three pools: the tactic pool, the fleet pool, or the strategy pool. TACTIC POOL During the action phase, players may spend command tokens from their tactic pool to perform tactical actions. FLEET POOL Players place command tokens in their fleet pool with the ship silhouette faceup. Players do not spend these command tokens like the command tokens in their other pools. Instead, the number of tokens in a player’s fleet pool is the maximum number of ships, excluding fighters, that he can have in each system. If a player ever has more ships in a system than he has tokens in his fleet pool, he must return ships from that system to his reinforcements until the number of ships in that system no longer exceeds the number of tokens in his fleet pool. STRATEGY POOL Most of the secondary abilities on strategy cards require a player to spend a token from his strategy pool to resolve the ability. Players will want to keep tokens in their strategy pool so that they can use the secondary abilities of the other players’ strategy cards. STRATEGIC ACTION Each strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability. When a player performs a strategic action, he resolves the primary ability of his strategy card. After resolving this ability, each other player may resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. The active player cannot resolve the secondary ability of his own strategy card. After each player has had an opportunity to resolve a strategy card’s secondary ability, the active player exhausts that strategy card by flipping it facedown. Players cannot resolve abilities on exhausted strategy cards, but the exhausted cards’ numbers are still used to determine initiative order. A player cannot pass during the action phase unless his strategy card is exhausted. This means that each player must perform a strategic action at some point during the action phase, which guarantees that each other player has an opportunity to resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. A player who has passed during the action phase can still resolve the secondary ability of other players’ strategy cards. COMPONENT ACTIONS A component action is an action that is printed on a game component. Many action cards, faction sheets, and even some technology cards have component actions. Each of these effects is preceded by the word “Action.” Exhausting a Strategy Card 2 CONDARY ABILIT SECONDARY ABILITY: SECONDARY ABILITY: ✦pend 1 to Spend 1 token from your to r strategy pool to ready up to 2 exhausted planets.

      "text": "11 7. REPAIR UNITS: Some units may have been turned on their side during the action phase to mark that they have been damaged. Players repair these units during this step by turning them upright. This is described in detail later. 8. RETURN STRATEGY CARDS: Each player returns his strategy card to the common play area. Then, if the custodians token is no longer on Mecatol Rex (the planet in the center of the game board) the game round continues to the agenda phase. Otherwise, a new game round begins with the strategy phase. AGENDA PHASE After the custodians token has been removed from Mecatol Rex, a new phase is added to each round for the remainder of the game: the agenda phase. During this phase, the galactic council convenes to discuss issues that affect the entire galaxy. Players vote for outcomes on two agendas, establishing laws and policies that have lasting repercussions. Voting on agendas is described in detail later. After resolving this phase, a new game round begins with the strategy phase. If there is no custodians token, players proceed to the agenda phase. 6 1 MECATOL REX 6 1 MECATOL REX The custodians token indicates that players begin a new game round. STATUS PHASE During the status phase, players perform various upkeep tasks, including repairing units and scoring objectives. To resolve the status phase, players perform the following steps in order: 1. SCORE OBJECTIVES: In initiative order, each player may score up to one public and one secret objective if he fulfills those cards’ requirements. This is the main way in which players gain the victory points they need to win the game. Objectives are described in detail later. 2. REVEAL PUBLIC OBJECTIVE: The speaker flips the next unrevealed public objective card faceup. The first stage II objective is not revealed until all stage I objectives have been revealed. 3. DRAW ACTION CARDS: Each player draws one card from the top of the action card deck. 4. REMOVE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player removes all of his command tokens from the game board and returns them to his reinforcements. 5. GAIN AND REDISTRIBUTE COMMAND TOKENS: Each player gains two command tokens from his reinforcements. Then, he may redistribute any of the command tokens on his command sheet by moving them between his tactic, fleet, and strategy pools. 6. READY CARDS: Each player readies all of his exhausted cards, including planet, technology, and strategy cards. KEY CONCEPT: READIED AND EXHAUSTED CARDS Many cards have a readied and an exhausted state. An exhausted card is flipped facedown, indicating that the values and abilities on the front of the card cannot be used. During the status phase, all exhausted cards are readied. A readied card is flipped faceup, indicating that the values and abilities on the front of the card can be used. 4 2 JORD Exhausted Card Distinctly seasonal, with the largest variety of climates and ecologies in the galaxy.

      "text": "12 If an objective’s timing specifies “Action Phase,” a player can score it during the action phase immediately after he fulfills its requirements. Scoring Objectives If a player fulfills an objective’s requirements at the time indicated on the card, he can score it. To do so, he advances his token on the victory point track a number of spaces equal to the value of the objective card. After scoring an objective, a player places a control token from his supply on that objective card to indicate that he has scored it and cannot score it again this game. If he scored a secret objective, he places the card faceup in front of him before placing a control token on it. Important: Each player can only score one public and one secret objective during each status phase and each step of the action phase. Imperium Rex The game can end early if no player has scored 10 victory points and there are no more objectives to reveal. When the speaker would reveal an objective but cannot, the game immediately ends and the player with the most victory points wins the game. If there is a tie, the player among the tied players who is earliest in initiative order wins the game. WINNING THE GAME A game of Twilight Imperium immediately ends when one player has gained 10 victory points. Players gain victory points by completing objectives. There are two types of objectives: ✦ ✦PUBLIC OBJECTIVES: During setup, the speaker reveals two public objectives, and more are revealed throughout the game. Any number of players can score each of these objectives. Important: A player cannot score public objectives if he does not control all of the planets in his home system. ✦ ✦SECRET OBJECTIVES: Each player begins the game with one secret objective that he may look at but must keep hidden from other players. A player can score his own secret objectives but not those belonging to other players. Important: A player cannot have more than three total scored and unscored secret objectives. If he draws a secret objective and has more than three, he must choose one of his unscored secret objectives and return it to the deck. Then, he shuffles the secret objective deck. Objective Timing Each objective specifies when a player can score it, either during the status phase or during the action phase. This timing is indicated directly below a card’s title. If a player scores an objective during the status phase, he must fulfill the requirement on the card during the “Score Objectives” step of the status phase to score that objective. For example, if an objective states that a player must control six planets outside of his home system, he must control those planets when he scores the objective— having controlled those planets earlier is not sufficient. Players can score some objectives by spending resources, influence, or tokens, as described by the objective card. To score such an objective, a player must pay the specified cost at the time indicated on the card. THREE– AND FOUR–PLAYER GAMES When playing the game with three or four players, players implement the following rules: ✦ ✦THE STRATEGY PHASE: After each player has chosen one strategy card during the strategy phase, players repeat the strategy card selection process until each player has chosen a second strategy card from the available cards. ✦ ✦INITIATIVE ORDER: Each player’s lowest-numbered strategy card is used to determine his placement in initiative order. ✦ ✦PASSING: A player cannot pass during the action phase unless both of his strategy cards are exhausted.

      "text": "13 2. MOVEMENT During the movement step of a tactical action, the active player may choose to move some of his units into the active system. Each ship has a move value printed on its faction sheet. This value indicates how far that ship can travel to reach the active system. For example, a ship with a move value of “1” can only move to adjacent systems. To resolve this step, the player chooses any of his units that can move into the active system and places them in that system. When moving a ship, a player must obey the following rules: ✦ ✦A ship must end its movement in the active system. ✦ ✦A ship cannot pass through a system that contains another player’s ships, excluding fighters. ✦ ✦A player cannot move units out of a system that contains one of his command tokens. Some ships have a capacity value printed on their faction sheets. When such a ship moves, it may transport a number of fighters and ground forces, in any combination, up to the ship’s capacity value. Transported ground forces and fighters move to the active system along with the ship that is transporting them. These units must remain with the ship in the space area, though ground forces may be able to land on planets during the invasion step. The active player’s ships may also pick up and transport ground forces and fighters from systems that they pass through that do not contain any of their command tokens. THE TACTICAL ACTION This section contains detailed rules for performing a tactical action. To perform a tactical action, players follow these steps in order: 1. ACTIVATION 2. MOVEMENT 3. SPACE COMBAT 4. INVASION 5. PRODUCTION These steps are described in detail in the following sections: 1. ACTIVATION The active player must choose one system that he would like to make the focus of his tactical action. He activates that system by taking a command token from his tactic pool and placing it on that system. That system is the active system for the remainder of the tactical action. A player cannot activate a system that already contains one of his command tokens, but he may activate a system that contains other players’ command tokens. A player also cannot activate a system if he does not have any command tokens in his tactic pool. MOVEMENT EXAMPLE The Xxcha player activates the Wellon system [1]. He intends to move his carrier into that system along with two infantry and two fighters [2]. His carrier can move to the system because it has a move of “1” [3]. It can also transport the infantry and fighters because it has a capacity of “4.” The Xxcha player has two other ships that have move values that are great enough to reach the active system. However, his cruiser [4] is in a system that has already been activated and his destroyer [5] cannot move through a system that contains another player’s ship [6]. As such, neither ship can move to the activated Wellon system. 19 2 1 WELLON 27 1 3 STARPOINT 1 1 NEW ALBION 22 1 1 TAR’MANN 50 20 2 2 VEFUT II 6 2 5 1 4 UPGRADE 4 COST 5 COMBAT 1 MOVE 1 CAPACITY 3 COST 9 COMBAT 1 MOVE 4 CAPACITY CARRIER I 1 COST COST FIGHTE 1 3"

      "text": "14 KEY CONCEPT: CAPACITY The number of fighters and ground forces that a player has in the space area of a system cannot exceed the combined capacity of that player’s ships in that system. For example, if a player has two carriers in a system, each with a capacity of “4,” that player cannot have a combination of more than eight fighters and ground forces in the space area of that system. Ground forces on planets do not count against this limitation. If at any time the number of a player’s fighters and ground forces in the space area of a system exceeds the capacity of his ships in that system, the excess units are destroyed. During combat, a player’s fighters and ground forces can exceed his ships’ capacity, but at the end of the combat, any excess units are destroyed. 3. SPACE COMBAT If multiple players have ships in the active system, they must resolve a space combat in that system. During combat, the active player is the attacker and the other player is the defender. Players resolve space combat by performing the following steps in order: i. ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: Each player’s units can use their “Anti-Fighter Barrage” abilities. ii. ANNOUNCE RETREAT: Either player may choose to announce a retreat. A retreat will not happen immediately; the units will retreat at the end of the combat round. If a player wishes to retreat with any of his ground forces that are on planets in the active system, he must move them from planets to the space area during this step. iii. MAKE COMBAT ROLLS: Each player rolls one die for each ship he has in the active system. If the result of a unit’s die roll is equal to or greater than that unit’s combat value shown on its faction sheet, that roll produces a hit. The total number of hits a player produces will be used in the next step. If a unit’s combat value contains two or more burst icons, the player rolls this number of dice instead, potentially producing one hit with each die rolled. iv. ASSIGN HITS: Each player must choose and destroy one of his ships for each hit his opponent produced. A player removes destroyed ships from the game board and places them in his reinforcements. Since players assign hits to their own units, it is a good strategy to assign hits to units that are cheaper to replace. Because of this, fighters are often used as fodder to protect the rest of a player’s ships. WORMHOLES Some system tiles contain wormholes. There are two types of basic wormholes–alpha and beta–as indicated by the wormhole’s symbol. Systems that contain identical wormholes are adjacent to one another for all purposes. ANOMALIES Some system tiles contain anomalies. These systems restrict movement and have special rules governing them. Asteroid Field ✦ ✦A ship cannot move through or into an asteroid field. Nebula ✦ ✦A ship cannot move through, but may move into a nebula. ✦ ✦A defender’s ship in a nebula applies +1 to the result of each of its combat rolls. ✦ ✦A ship moving out of a nebula has a move value of 1. Supernova ✦ ✦A ship cannot move through or into a supernova. Gravity Rift ✦ ✦A ship that moves through or out of a gravity rift applies +1 to its move value and then rolls one die; on a result of 1–3, the ship is destroyed. SPACE CANNON OFFENSE After the active player’s ships move into the active system, each player’s units in the active system may use their “Space Cannon” abilities against the active player’s ships in that system. The active player may also use his units’ “Space Cannon” abilities at this time. The “Space Cannon” ability is explained in detail later.

      "text": "15 End of Space Combat If both players have units remaining in the combat at the end of the “Retreat” step, they resolve another round of combat starting with the “Announce Retreat” step. After all units on one or both sides of the combat have been destroyed or have retreated, play proceeds to the invasion step. Some objectives require a player to win a combat; a player has won a space combat if he is the only player with ships remaining in the active system when the combat has ended. 4. INVASION The active player can invade planets in the active system. Players resolve an invasion by performing the following steps in order: i. BOMBARDMENT: If any planets in the active system contain another player’s ground forces, the active player may use the “Bombardment” abilities of any of his units in that system. This may allow the active player to destroy some of the defender’s units before landing ground forces. Bombardment is described in detail later. ii. COMMIT GROUND FORCES: The active player decides which ground forces he wishes to land on planets. To do so, he takes any of his ground forces that are with his ships in the space area of the active system and places each one on the planet he wishes to invade. iii. SPACE CANNON DEFENSE: If another player has a PDS on any of the planets the active player has committed ground forces to, he may be able to destroy some of those ground forces before they land. The “Space Cannon” ability is described in detail later. iv. GROUND COMBAT: If multiple players have ground forces on the same planet, those players resolve a ground combat. Ground combats on multiple planets are resolved in the order of the active player’s choice. Players resolve ground combat over a number of rounds that each consist of two steps, following the same rules as the space combat steps of the same name: 1. Make Combat Rolls 2. Assign Hits After assigning hits, if multiple players have units remaining on the planet, they resolve another round of ground combat starting with the “Make Combat Rolls” step. After all units on one or both sides of the combat have been destroyed, proceed to the next step. v. ESTABLISH CONTROL: The active player gains control of each invaded planet that still contains at least one of his ground forces. When a player gains control of a planet, he gains its corresponding planet card and places it in his play area exhausted. Then, if the planet contains structures that belong to another player, those structures are destroyed. v. RETREAT: If a player announced a retreat during the first step of the combat round, he retreats. To retreat, the player takes all of his ships from the combat and places them in an adjacent system. The chosen system cannot contain ships that belong to another player and must contain either a planet he controls or at least one of his units; otherwise, the player cannot retreat. If the chosen system does not contain one of that player’s command tokens, the player must place one token from his reinforcements in that system when he retreats. SPACE COMBAT EXAMPLE The green player has activated and moved ships into a system that contains the yellow player’s ships [1]. As such, a space combat begins. Both players roll one die for each ship in the space combat [2]. The green player’s roll produces only one hit while the yellow player’s rolls produce two hits. The green player must assign hits to two of his ships. He chooses to destroy two of his fighters. The yellow player must assign a hit to one of his ships. He chooses to destroy one of his cruisers [3]. The next round of combat begins [4]. This round, the green player’s roll produces two hits while the yellow player’s roll produces one hit. The green player assigns a hit and destroys a fighter while the yellow player must assign the hit to his only ship, a cruiser [5]. Since the yellow player has no ships remaining in the combat, the combat ends and the green player wins. 20 2 2 VEFUT II 20 2 2 VEFUT II 2 3 4 5 1"

      "text": "16 If a player’s space docks are in the same system as another player’s ships, those space docks are blockaded. Blockaded space docks cannot produce ships. They may, however, still produce ground forces. KEY CONCEPT: SPENDING RESOURCES AND INFLUENCE Many effects in Twilight Imperium require a player to spend resources or influence. To spend a planet’s resources or influence, a player exhausts that planet’s planet card. For example, if a player needs to spend two resources to produce units, he can exhaust a planet that has a resource value of “2” or instead exhaust two planets that each have resource values of “1.” The player could exhaust a planet that has more resources, but the excess resources are lost. 5. PRODUCTION The active player can produce units using his space docks in the active system. When a player produces units, he may choose to produce any of the units on his faction sheet by spending resources equal to the chosen unit’s cost. When a unit is produced, the player takes the unit from his reinforcements and places it in the active system. Players always place ships in the space area of the system in which they were produced. Players always place ground forces on the planet that contains the space dock that produced them. When producing multiple units at a time, the cost values of those units are added together to determine the total cost. Each space dock’s “Production” ability has a value that limits the number of units that it can produce during this step. A player cannot produce more units than the combined production values of his units in the active system. If a unit’s cost is accompanied by two icons, such as the cost values of fighters and infantry, the player receives two units for the indicated cost. When producing these units, each individual unit counts against the production limit. When a player wishes to produce a unit but has no units of that type available in his reinforcements, he may remove one of his units of that type from a system that does not contain one of his command tokens on the game board and return it to his reinforcements. When a player produces a fighter or infantry unit, but has none in his reinforcements, he can use fighter or infantry tokens from the supply instead. These tokens function identically to plastic figures of that type; however, they must be accompanied by at least one plastic figure of that type that matches his color.

He will be producing units from the space dock located on Archon Tau [2]. He intends to produce one carrier and as many infantry as he can afford. His space dock has a production value of “3,” meaning that it can produce up to three units. The cost of a carrier is three resources, and the cost of two infantry is one resource [3], so he will need to exhaust at least four resources total to produce them. After exhausting both of his planet cards, he is still one resource short, so he must spend one trade good (detailed on the following page). Then, he places two infantry [4] on Archon Tau and one carrier [5] in the space area of that system tile. 14 ARCHON TAU 1 1 ARCHON REN 3 2 1 2 Ravaged by Sol and Letnev e bombardments during the Twilight Xxcha com Wars.

      "text": "17 When a player gives another player a commodity, that commodity converts into a trade good; the player receiving the commodity flips the token to its trade good side. Players are encouraged to replenish commodities through the “Trade” strategy card and trade them to one another in mutually beneficial transactions. NEIGHBORS, TRANSACTIONS, AND DEALS As players move their ships about the galaxy and invade planets, they will undoubtedly come into contact with other players’ empires. While this may often lead to war over planets and systems, it does not have to. Neighboring players can peacefully trade with each other. If a player has a unit or controls a planet in a system that is adjacent to a system that contains a unit or planet that another player controls, those two players are neighbors. During the active player’s turn, he may negotiate a transaction with one or more of his neighbors, even during a combat. As part of a transaction, the negotiating players may exchange any number of trade goods and commodities. The active player may negotiate only once with each of his neighbors per turn. After a transaction has been finalized, no other transactions may occur between those players that turn. Frequently, players will negotiate transactions that go beyond a simple exchange of goods. These transactions are called deals. For example, the active player might move his ships into a system that contains another player’s PDS, at which point the active player might offer the owner of that PDS a trade good to refrain from using the “Space Cannon” ability. Because the effect can be resolved immediately, this deal is a binding deal. When a deal is binding, a player must honor his end of the bargain. In the previous example, if the owner of the PDS agrees to this deal and takes the trade good, he cannot fire his PDS as this would violate their agreement. Not all deals are binding, however. For example, a player might offer another player a trade good to attack a specific player during a later turn. Because the effect cannot be resolved immediately, this deal is a non-binding deal. The player who was given the trade good, despite the terms of the deal, is not required to honor his end of the bargain and may fulfill or ignore the deal as he chooses. The red player is a neighbor to both the blue player and the Xxcha player. 50 04 1 4 MUAAT 20 2 2 VEFUT II ADDITIONAL RULES This section contains additional rules that players need to understand to play their first game. ACTION CARDS Throughout the game, players will accumulate action cards. Players can use action cards to resolve powerful one-time abilities. Each player can have a maximum of seven action cards in his hand. If a player exceeds this number, he must choose which seven cards he wishes to keep and discard the rest. Each action card indicates when it can be used at the top of its card. When an action card is used, the player using it reveals the card, resolves its effect, and discards the card. If an action card begins with the word “Action,” it can be used as a component action during a player’s turn of the action phase. TRADE GOODS AND COMMODITIES Trade goods are a universal currency that players will use to produce units or bribe other empires. A player may spend a trade good as either one resource or one influence. Players may also accumulate commodities. A commodity represents a product that is plentiful within a player’s empire. Commodities have no inherent value but become trade goods when given to another player. Both trade goods and commodities are represented by opposite sides of the same token, and exist in values of “1” or “3.” During the game, players may replenish commodities by using the abilities of the “Trade” strategy card. When a player replenishes commodities, he takes commodity tokens from the supply until he has a number of tokens equal to the commodities value on his faction sheet. A player cannot have more commodities than that printed value. RADE RADE 6 This unit’s PRODUCTION value is equal to 2 more than the resource value of this planet.

      "text": "18 Researching Technology Players gain new technology by researching it, usually by using the “Technology” strategy card. To research a technology, players must satisfy the prerequisites of the technology they wish to research. Prerequisites are printed as a column on the lower-left side of each technology card and contain one or more symbols that correspond to the four basic technology colors. Some technologies have no prerequisites and can be researched without owning any technology. To satisfy a technology’s prerequisites, a player must own a matching technology for each prerequisite symbol on the card he wishes to research. For example, a player that owns two red technologies may research the red technology “Duranium Armor,” as it has two red prerequisites. After the player researches the “Duranium Armor” technology, it satisfies another red prerequisite, as indicated on the lower‑right corner of the card; the next time that player researches a technology, he may research a technology that has three red symbols as a prerequisite. Unit upgrade technologies, unlike other technologies, may have prerequisites composed of multiple colors. Additionally, unit upgrade technologies do not satisfy prerequisites when researching technology. Technology Specialties Some planets provide the player with a technology specialty. Technology specialties are extremely valuable and help players research new technologies. If a player controls a planet that has a technology specialty symbol, he may exhaust that planet when researching technology to ignore a prerequisite that matches that technology specialty. While researching technology, players may exhaust planets for their technology specialty or for their resources, but not for both. 31 1 0 LAZAR The only inhabited world in a forgettable system. Few native resources and only rudimentary, often underdeveloped, industries. 0 1 LAZAR TECHNOLOGY During the game, players will gain technology in the form of technology cards. Technologies provide players with powerful abilities and allow players to upgrade their units. Each player has an identical deck of technology cards that he may look through at any time, as well as a number of faction technology cards that he set aside during setup. There are four basic colors of technology. A technology’s color is indicated by a green, red, blue, or yellow symbol located on the lower-right corner of the card. Players use these symbols when researching technology. Each player begins the game with a number of starting technologies as indicated on the back of his faction sheet. Additionally, a player can research new technologies from his deck during the game. A player places his starting technologies and any technology he researches faceup in his play area. After a technology is faceup in a player’s play area, that player owns that technology. A player’s owned technologies remain in play for the duration of the game and their abilities can be used as described on the card. Some technologies have the word “Action” in their card text; players can resolve these cards by using a component action during the action phase. Some technologies are unit upgrade technologies. Unit upgrades technologies match a unit on a player’s faction sheet. When a player gains a unit upgrade technology, he places its card over the corresponding unit on his faction sheet. The white arrows next to an attribute’s value on the faction sheet indicate that the attribute will improve when its unit is upgraded. When a unit is upgraded, all the player’s units of that type, both on the game board and in his reinforcements, now have the attributes shown on the unit upgrade technology.

      "text": "19 Some of these abilities are followed by a second number presented inside parentheses. This number indicates how many dice a player rolls. For example, when a player uses an ability that reads “Space Cannon 5 (x3),” he rolls three dice and each die with a result of “5” or higher produces one hit. If an ability that requires a roll does not contain a number inside parentheses, a player only rolls one die. Hits that are produced by abilities are assigned immediately. When a hit is produced against a player’s units, he chooses and destroys one of his units. Players use each of these abilities at different times and can hit different types of units as described below: ✦ ✦ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE: A player uses this ability during the “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step of the first round of space combat. These hits can only be assigned to fighters. ✦ ✦BOMBARDMENT: A player uses this ability during the “Bombardment” step of an invasion. These hits can only be assigned by the bombarded player to ground forces on the planet being bombarded. If there are multiple planets in the system, the active player must choose which of his units in the system are bombarding which planets before rolling dice. ✦ ✦SPACE CANNON: A player can use this ability at two different times, as follows: ✦ ✦After the “Movement” step of a tactical action, all players can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of their units that are in the active system. The player whose units the ability was used against must assign these hits to ships in that system. ✦ ✦During the “Space Cannon Defense” step of an invasion, the player who controls the planet being invaded can use the “Space Cannon” abilities of his units on that planet. The invading player must assign these hits to his ground forces that are invading the planet. PLANET TRAITS Most planets outside of home systems have a planet trait. There are three types of planets: cultural, hazardous, and industrial. Traits have no inherent game effect, but are referred to by some cards and abilities. UNIT ABILITIES Many units in the game have unit abilities that appear as bulleted keywords on faction sheets and unit upgrade technology cards. The rules for these abilities are as follows: PLANETARY SHIELD If a unit has the “Planetary Shield” ability, the planet where that unit is located is not an eligible target for other units’ “Bombardment” abilities. SUSTAIN DAMAGE If a unit has the “Sustain Damage” ability, it can become damaged to cancel one hit. A damaged unit is turned on its side but otherwise functions as it did previously. A damaged unit cannot use “Sustain Damage” until it is repaired either during the status phase or by another game effect. PRODUCTION A unit with the “Production” ability, such as a space dock, can produce new units. This ability is always followed by a value which dictates the maximum number of units that a unit that has this ability can produce. See “Production” on page 16. OFFENSIVE ABILITIES The following abilities require a player to roll dice to determine whether or not another player’s units are hit: “Anti-Fighter Barrage,” “Bombardment,” and “Space Cannon.” These abilities are always followed by a number that determines the minimum die result required to produce a hit. For example, “Bombardment 5” indicates that the player rolls a single die, and if the result is five or greater, it produces one hit. Cultural Planet Industrial Planet Hazardous Planet Damaged Dreadnought Undamaged Dreadnought"

      "text": "20 1. FIRST AGENDA To resolve an agenda, players perform the following steps: i. Reveal Agenda The speaker draws one agenda card from the top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to all players, including its possible outcomes. ii. Vote Each player, starting with the player to the left of the speaker and continuing clockwise, casts votes in favor of a single outcome. When it is a player’s turn to cast votes, he may exhaust any number of his planets. Each planet contributes a number of votes equal to its influence value. Outcomes The outcomes that a player can vote for depend upon the type of agenda: ✦ ✦FOR OR AGAINST: The player commits his votes “For” or “Against” the agenda. The agenda card will have different results according to the outcome that receives the most votes. ✦ ✦ELECT PLAYER: The player commits his votes for the player of his choice, including himself. ✦ ✦ELECT PLANET: The player commits his votes for the planet of his choice. That planet must be controlled by a player unless the agenda specifies otherwise. When casting votes, the player announces the outcome he is voting for aloud. For example, a player may say, “I’m casting three votes to elect the Hacan player” or “I’m casting three votes against this agenda.” A player can only vote for one outcome per agenda. For example, he cannot cast votes for two different players. He may, however, choose to abstain from the vote entirely. Transactions During each vote, players may freely negotiate transactions with other players, even if they are not neighbors with those players. Each player may negotiate up to one transaction with each other player while resolving the vote for each agenda. This often involves convincing players to vote for certain outcomes using trade goods or future promises. iii. Resolve Outcome Players count votes and resolve the outcome with the most votes. Each agenda will be one of two types: a directive or a law. Directives When resolving a directive, players resolve the outcome that received the most votes and discard the agenda card immediately. THE GALACTIC COUNCIL This section contains rules for the agenda phase, which is added to the game after a player gains control of Mecatol Rex. The agenda phase involves heavy negotiation and political maneuvering. CUSTODIANS OF MECATOL REX The custodians token represents the caretakers that safeguard Mecatol Rex until one of the great races can claim the throne. Players may freely move units into the Mecatol Rex system, but cannot land ground forces on the planet while the custodians token is present. To remove this token, the active player must spend six influence immediately before landing ground forces on the planet. If the player cannot spend six influence, he cannot land ground forces on the planet. When a player removes the custodians token, he places it in his play area and gains one victory point. Since the galactic council can now convene on Mecatol Rex, the agenda phase is added as the last phase of each game round, including the round during which a player gained control of Mecatol Rex. THE AGENDA PHASE After the agenda phase has been added to the game, the galactic council votes upon issues that affect the entire galaxy. These issues are referred to as agendas and are represented by agenda cards. Each agenda card has text that includes a number of possible outcomes. Each outcome will affect the game, and players will vote for which outcome they want to occur. To resolve the agenda phase, players perform the following steps in order: 1. FIRST AGENDA i. REVEAL AGENDA ii. VOTE iii. RESOLVE OUTCOME 2. SECOND AGENDA i. REVEAL AGENDA ii. VOTE iii. RESOLVE OUTCOME 4. READY PLANETS DIRECTIVE When this agenda is revealed, if there are no laws in play, discard this card and reveal another agenda from the top of the deck. For: Discard all laws from play. At the start of the next strategy phase, each player exhausts each planet in his home system. Against: No eﬀ ect. E NEW CONST CONSTITUTION"

      "text": "21 ADVANCED RULES After players have played their first game, they should use the advanced rules found in this section. COMPLETE SETUP This booklet contains rules for an abridged “First-Game Setup” to facilitate players’ first time playing the game. During setup for a standard game, players have a wider array of factions to choose from, many of which are more complex than the factions suggested in the “First-Game Setup.” During setup, players are dealt a hand of system tiles to create the galaxy instead of using a preset map. Full rules for setup can be found in the “Complete Setup” section on page 2 of the Rules Reference. Additionally, during setup, players will receive promissory notes, a type of card that players can use to facilitate negotiations with other players. Finally, players who wish to play a longer game may use the 14-space side of the victory point track. PROMISSORY NOTES Each player begins the game with five promissory note cards; four of which match his player color, and one faction-specific card. A promissory note helps players negotiate with each other by creating an enforceable contract between them. A player can offer a promissory note to another player as part of a transaction. Each promissory note contains text that describes the card’s effect and indicates when the card can be resolved. A player cannot resolve his own promissory notes, but he can resolve other players’ notes that he receives from a transaction. When a player resolves a promissory note, he reveals the card and resolves its text effect. Though some promissory notes will stay in play after they are resolved, a promissory note is usually returned to its original owner and may again be offered by that player as part of a transaction. When a player offers a promissory note to another player as part of a transaction, the offering player may allow the receiving player to view the card being offered if he wishes. A player cannot trade more than one promissory note during a single transaction. Players can also exchange promissory notes that they have received from other players. This does not require permission from the promissory note’s original owner. When you receive this card, if you are not the blue player, you must place it faceup in your play area and gain 1 victory point. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the blue player’s units, or if the blue player is eliminated, lose 1 victory point and return this card to the blue player. SUPPORT FOR THE THRONE Laws When resolving a law, if a “For” outcome received the most votes, or if the law requires an election, the law’s effect becomes a permanent part of the game. Players resolve the outcome and place the agenda card in the common play area unless the effect specifies otherwise. If an “Against” outcome received the most votes, players resolve the text effect of the outcome and discard the agenda immediately. Ties If multiple outcomes receive the same number of votes after all players have voted, the speaker decides which of the tied outcomes is resolved. 2. SECOND AGENDA Players resolve a second agenda following the same rules and steps for step 1, “First Agenda.” 3. READY PLANETS Each player readies all of his planet cards. Then, the agenda phase ends and players begin a new game round, starting with the strategy phase. STOP! Now, players know all the rules necessary to play their first game. As questions arise during the game, players are encouraged to consult the Rules Reference for answers regarding the topic in question rather than referring to this Learn To Play booklet. Players that are already familiar with the game should read the rules for complete setup and promissory notes in the next column. Pax magnifica bellum gloriosum!"
