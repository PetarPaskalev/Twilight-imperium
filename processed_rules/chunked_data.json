Less than a thousand leagues from my tower, great shields protect us from the poisonous dust that is the Sea of Desolation, the terrible wasteland that covers most of the planet.

Being the last civilization to be admitted into the imperial council, it is ironic that Sol was the first to openly declare war against the failing empire. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating the minor conflict into the full scale galactic war known as the Twilight Wars. The Sol Federation of Nations is governed by the bi-annually elected High Minister, who has the executive control of the economy, budget, and Sol military. The executive powers of the High Minister are held in check by three distinct governing houses: The House of Law, The House of the People, and The House of Industry",

Players use these units to engage one another in space combat and expand their empires to new systems. Ground Forces Ground forces represent foot soldiers. Players use these units to invade planets or defend their own territories. Structures Structures represent military installations built by an empire to support its war effort.

FLEET POOL Players place command tokens in their fleet pool with the ship silhouette faceup. Players do not spend these command tokens like the command tokens in their other pools.

To spend a planet’s resources or influence, a player exhausts that planet’s planet card. For example, if a player needs to spend two resources to produce units, he can exhaust a planet that has a resource value of “2” or instead exhaust two planets that each have resource values of “1.” The player could exhaust a planet that has more resources, but the excess resources are lost. 5",

When a player produces units, he may choose to produce any of the units on his faction sheet by spending resources equal to the chosen unit’s cost. When a unit is produced, the player takes the unit from his reinforcements and places it in the active system. Players always place ships in the space area of the system in which they were produced. Players always place ground forces on the planet that contains the space dock that produced them.

Each promissory note contains text that describes the card’s effect and indicates when the card can be resolved.

Non-Fighter Ships and Mechs If a player captures a non-fighter ship or mech, they place it on their faction sheet. When such a unit is returned, it is placed in the reinforcements of the player who it was captured from.

ADDITIONAL PLAYERS This expansion adds components to enable seven-player and eight-player games.

WORMHOLE NEXUS The wormhole nexus is a unique region of the galaxy where numerous wormholes converge. It is a two-sided system tile— the inactive side displays only a gamma wormhole, and the active side displays three wormholes. The nexus is treated as part of the game board, and it begins the game inactive, meaning it is only adjacent to tiles that have a gamma wormhole. The first time a player moves or places a unit into the wormhole nexus or gains control of its planet (Mallice), the nexus becomes active and the player flips it to its active side.

The humans themselves represent the most numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy.

Players use these units to engage one another in space combat and expand their empires to new systems. Ground Forces Ground forces represent foot soldiers. Players use these units to invade planets or defend their own territories. Structures Structures represent military installations built by an empire to support its war effort.

To spend a planet’s resources or influence, a player exhausts that planet’s planet card.

Then a billowing, hissing cloud of steam erupted from the column, hiding it from view. “We need to leave,” Teallian said. “Sinassa?” The Creuss warrior looked at her, then nodded. “Yes, I think so.

The nexus is treated as part of the game board, and it begins the game inactive, meaning it is only adjacent to tiles that have a gamma wormhole.

CLARIFICATIONS This section includes clarifications about timings, interactions, and easily overlooked rules. If the players have a question, they should look here or consult the Living Rules Reference online. Anti-Fighter Barrage ✦The “Anti-Fighter Barrage” step can occur even if a player’s opponent has no fighters in the combat. Captured Fighters and Infantry ✦If a player captures a fighter or infantry unit, it is returned to its reinforcements and the capturing player places a fighter or infantry token from the supply on their faction sheet",

Dimensional Tear Tokens ✦If a space dock that has a dimensional tear token under it is destroyed, the dimensional tear token is removed from the board. ✦The Nekro Virus have their own dimensional tear tokens that they can use if they copy the Vuil’raith Cabal’s “Dimensional Tear II” unit upgrade technology card. Exploration ✦A planet that does not have a type cannot be explored. ✦If an ability instructs a player to explore a frontier token, they may do so even if they do not have the “Dark Energy Tap” technology. Frontier Tokens ✦During setup, a frontier token is placed in each non-home system that does not contain planets, including anomalies. Gravity Rifts ✦Players apply +1 to the move values of ships for each gravity rift they move through, but must roll for each rift as well",

Relics ✦Relics cannot be exchanged as part of a transaction even though relic fragments can be exchanged. Wormhole Nexus ✦If the wormhole nexus would become active after a ship moves to it during the “Movement” step of a tactical action, it does not become active until the end of that step.",
