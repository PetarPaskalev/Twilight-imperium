      "Faction Abilities": "• MITOSIS: Your space docks cannot produce infantry. At the start of the status phase, place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on any planet you control.",
      "FAQ": "Q: Can the Arborec's \"Mitosis\" ability be used to place 1 infantry on every planet they control? A: No. Only 1 infantry may be placed on a single planet using this ability. Q: Can the secondary ability of the “Warfare” strategy card be used to trigger the “Production” ability of the Arborec’s Letani Warriors? A: No, the “Warfare” secondary ability can only be used to trigger the production ability of space docks, and thus cannot be used by the Arborec to produce additional infantry. Q: Can the “Production” abilities of multiple Arborec “Letani Warriors” in a system be combined to allow the production of two infantry for one resource? A: Yes. Production value is totaled when the “Production” ability of units in a system is used. Q: Does the Arborec flagship (The “Duha Menaimon”) need to be in a system when it is activated to make use of its ability? A: Yes. The “Duha Menaimon” can only be used to produce units when it is in a system at the moment it is activated. Q: Can the technology \"Sarween Tools\" be used to reduce the cost of units produced by the Duha Menaimon? A: No. Sarween tools can only be used when a unit specifically uses the PRODUCTION ability Q: When using the Arborec's hero ability \"Ultrasonic Emitter\", does the cost for the produced units need to be paid for? A: Yes. Any game effect that instructs a player to produce units requires them to pay for them unless otherwise specified.",

      "FAQ": "Q: How does the Agenda \"Publicize Weapon Schematics\" affect the Embers of Muaat's War Suns? A: Prototype War Sun I is considered a war sun but is a printed unit not a war sun technology. Thus, a vote of \"For\" would mean that it would lose the Sustain Damage ability but other players would not be able to ignore war sun prerequisites. A vote of \"Against\" would not affect the Muaat player. The agenda plays as normal if the Muaat player has researched Prototype War Sun II. Q: How does The Embers of Muaat Hero, Nova Seed, interact with tokens (e.g. wormholes, Mirage)? A: Nova Seed also purges all tokens other than command tokens and frontier tokens. Any faction specific tokens are returned to that faction. Q: Does the Muaat Gashlai Physiology ability allow them to move their ships into Supernovas? A: No, moving through a system is distinct from moving into a system.

      "FAQ": "Q: Can the Creuss Promissory note still be used if the Creuss have not researched “Wormhole Generator”? A: Yes, the promissory note does not require that the “Wormhole Generator” technology have been researched. Q: Can the “Light/Wave Deflector” technology be used to move through a wormhole created by the Ghosts of Creuss’ “Hil Colish” flagship? A: Yes, “Light/Wave Deflector” would allow a player other than the Ghosts of Creuss to move their fleet through the “Hil Colish’s” system into Creuss system or the Creuss Gate system. Q: If the “Hil Colish” moves before other ships and is returned to reinforcements by a gravity rift, can other ships still use its delta wormhole to reach the active system? A: No, the wormhole ceases to exist when the “Hil Colish” is returned to reinforcements. Q: If there is an ‘A’ wormhole on Mecatol Rex when the “Ixthian Artifact” agenda causes units in adjacent systems to be destroyed, does the \"Quantum Entanglement\" ability cause the Ghost of Creuss faction to lose units in a system that contains a ‘B’ wormhole? A: Yes, since each player has to destroy the units himself and the Creuss player treats those systems as adjacent. Q: When multiple ships with capacity move through wormholes, how many fighters are placed with the Ghosts Commander, Sai Seravus? A: When Sai Seravus is used, fighters are placed in the active system one at a time, up to the number of ships with capacity that moved through wormholes, or the capacity limit in the system is reached, whichever happens first. Q: How does the Ghosts of Creuss Hero, Singularity Reactor, interact with tokens (e.g. wormholes, Mirage)? A: All tokens stay with their original tile. v · d · eFactions and RacesFourth ion ● Third ion ● Second ion ● First ionFourth ionBase GameThe Arborec ● The Barony of Letnev ● The Clan of Saar ● The Embers of Muaat ● The Emirates of Hacan ● The Federation of Sol ● The Ghosts of Creuss ● The L1Z1X Mindnet ● The Mentak Coalition ● The Naalu Collective ● The Nekro Virus ● Sardakk N'orr ● The Universities of Jol-Nar ● The Winnu ● The Xxcha Kingdom ● The Yin Brotherhood ● The Yssaril TribesProphecy of Kings ExpansionThe Argent Flight ● The Empyrean ● The Mahact Gene-Sorcerers ● The Naaz-Rokha Alliance ● The Nomad ● The Titans of Ul ● The Vuil'Raith CabalCodexThe Council KeleresThird ionBase GameThe Barony of Letnev ● The Emirates of Hacan ● The Federation of Sol ● The L1Z1X Mindnet ● The Mentak Coalition ● The Naalu Collective ● Sardakk N'orr ● The Universities of Jol-Nar ● The Xxcha Kingdom ● The Yssaril TribesShattered Empire ExpansionThe Clan of Saar ● The Embers of Muaat ● The Winnu ● The Yin BrotherhoodShards of the Throne ExpansionThe Arborec ● The Ghosts of Creuss ● The Nekro Virus ● The LazaxFaction AttributesGameplayFaction Abilities ● Faction Promissory Notes ● Faction Technologies ● Faction Specific Units ● Flagships ● Faction Starting Fleets ● Faction Starting Technology ● Faction Home Systems ● List of Factions by Play ComplexityLoreFaction Government and Leadership ● Faction Disposition‎ ● List of Factions by Home System Population ● List of Factions by Tendencies ● Faction Colors",

A: Yes, even in the case of “Quantum Entanglement” only being active from the Creuss’ point of view, because the ‘neighbor’ status is active as a result of the ability, the Mentak may use their “Pillage” in these situations. Q: Can the Mentak Coalition use the “Pillage” faction ability for each time the Saar gain a trade good from the “Scavenge” faction ability in a single turn, provided that the other requirements are met?

      "FAQ": "Q: Does the Naalu flagship (“The Matriarch”) allow the Naalu to take gain control of a planet using only fighters? A: No. The Naalu fighters return to the space area when ground combat ends. If no Naalu ground forces are present, the combat is considered to be a draw, and the Naalu do not gain control of the planet during the “Establish Control” step. Q: Using the Naalu flagship (“The Matriarch”) in combination with the “Dacxive Animators” technology, can the Naalu gain control of a planet using only fighters? A: No, as you cannot win (only draw) ground combat with only Naalu fighters (see above question). However, if you could somehow win, the exact sequence of events if you win the ground combat would be to place an infantry with Daxcive Animators, return the fighters to the space area, then take control of the planet during the \"Establish Control\" step. Q: Does the Naalu “0” token move with the strategy card it is placed on if the card is exchanged with or taken by another player? A: No. The Naalu “0” token stays with the Naalu or the faction that gained the token through the “Gift of Prescience” promissory note and is placed on any of that player’s strategy cards. Q: Can the Naalu Collective commander, M’aban, or the Yin Brotherhood commander, Brother Omar, allow the player to choose to produce only 1 infantry/fighter and then another with their commander? A: Yes, both of these commanders allow the player to choose to only build a single fighter/infantry for 1 resource and gain an additional unit of that type each time they do. Q: The Naalu Collective agent, Z’eu Omega, says \"resolve a tactical action\" but this is during a component action. How does this work for the Mahact Gene-Sorceres mech, Starlancer? Master Plan? Ministers of Peace and War? Who is the active player for abilities/transactions? Can Naalu use Fleet Logistics after this action? Can players who passed use it? A: The Naalu Collective agent, Z’eu Omega is a component action that allows a player to take a tactical action and effectively makes them the active player for the duration of the tactical action (and any actions that may occur after, due to further abilities causing further actions). This DOES NOT count as the tactical action player’s turn, so they cannot utilize fleet logistics, however they could use Master Plan or the Minister of War, as these reference tactical actions and not a player’s turn. Minister of Peace and the Mahact Gene-Sorcerers mech, Starlancer ends the turn of the tactical action player, regardless of referencing a “turn”. Q: When Covert Legislation is revealed, is there a window in which the Naalu Collective commander, M’aban Omega, can look at the next agenda card? Can they look while the Politics player is resolving the primary of that strategy card, or while putting them on the top/bottom? A: The Naalu Collective Commander, M’aban Omega, cannot look at the next card when Covert Legislation is revealed before the speaker draws the top card of the agenda deck. It also cannot be used to interrupt the primary ability of the Politics strategy card. Q: When using the primary ability of diplomacy on a system that has Naalu ships, does this activate the ability of Neuroglaive and force all players to place a token from their fleet pool into their reinforcements? A: No. That system is not activated by the use of the \"Diplomacy\" strategy card.",

      "FAQ": "Q: Can the Nekro Virus use the “Valefar Assimilator” technologies on printed faction units such as the Embers of Muaat’s Prototype War Sun I? A: No, printed faction units are not technologies, and thus are ineligible targets for “Valefar Assimilator.” Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count as ships for the purpose of card effects and fleet supply? A: Infantry that are participating in space combat via “The Alastor” do count as ships (in addition to their own unit type) for the purpose of card effects, but, as a unit that can be transported, they do not count against fleet supply in that system. Q: Can infantry involved in a space combat by using the ability of “The Alastor” flagship be used in an invasion after the space combat? Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship cease participation in combat if the Alastor is destroyed? A: No. Infantry that are committed to the space combat due to the effects of \"The Alastor\" continue to participate until the end of the combat, even if \"The Alastor\" is destroyed. Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count toward the ships required to use the “Assault Cannon” technology? A: Yes. These infantry may be used to resolve “Assault Cannon.” Q: Does the Winnu “Salai Sai Corian” flagship get additional dice for infantry participating in a fight due to the Nekro “Alastor” flagship? A: Yes. The “Salai Sai Corian” would get one additional die per infantry. Q: Can the Nekro Virus have both a standard and a faction-specific unit upgrade of the same type? A: Yes. Only the faction-specific unit upgrade technology will be in effect, but should the Nekro lose the faction-specific upgrade technology that is being copied by the “Valefar Assimilator,” they would revert to the standard unit upgrade technology that was previously inactive. Q: If the Nekro Virus owns multiple unit upgrade technologies of the same type, such as “Dreadnought II” and “Exotrireme II,” does each one count toward the “Develop Weaponry” and “Revolutionize Warfare” objectives? A: No. Only one upgrade of a given type counts toward those objectives. Q: Can a player who cannot vote (such as the Nekro Virus) play \"rider\" action cards? A: Yes. The Nekro player, or a player who cannot vote due to another effect, can still play \"rider\" action cards. Q: Can the Nekro Virus player play a \"rider\" action card along with their \"Galactic threat\" faction ability? A: Yes, the Nekro Virus may play \"rider\" action cards in addition to using their Galactic threat faction ability for the same agenda. Q: Can the Nekro Virus player play the action cards \"Bribery\" or \"Distinguished Councillor\"? A: No. The Nekro Virus player is unable to vote and so cannot use these cards to gain votes. Q: If the Nekro Virus' Valefar Assimilator technology is copying another player's faction technology and that player is eliminated, does the Valefar Assimilator token remain on that technology? A: Yes. If a player becomes eliminated and the Nekro Virus Valefar Assimilator X or Y token is on one of their faction technologies, that technology remains in play. Q: Can the Nekro Virus score the secret objective \"Adapt New Strategies\"? A: Although Valefar Assimilators themselves do not count, once other faction technologies are copied by them, those faction technologies count for the purpose of this objective. Q: Can the Nekro Virus player use the Prophet's Tears Relic? A: Yes, when the Nekro virus player uses their Propagation faction ability, they could exhaust the Relic to gain an action card. They cannot do this when they GAIN technology via their Technological Singularity faction ability. Q: If the Universities of Jol-Nar player replaces a faction technology with their hero, what happens if the Nekro Virus player had a Valefar Assimilator token on it? A: The token stays on the tech in the tech-deck and Valefar Assimilator still has that technology’s text. Q: Can I use the Nekro Virus’ Agent, Nekro Malleon, or Psychoarchaeology or the Hacan Agent to interrupt another ability since the timing is “during the action phase”? A: No, any ability that is used “during the action phase” cannot be resolved unless there are no other abilities currently being resolved. Q: Are ground forces participating in combat via the Nekro Virus’ Flagship, The Alastor, in the space area? Are they affected by Argent Flight's Strike Wing Alpha II's ability? A: Ground Forces participating in space combat via The Alastor do not move from their origin location. If they were on planets at the start of combat, they stay on the planet, participate in combat, and are immune to SWA2’s ability. If they started in space, they are in space and are subject to SWA2’s ability.",

Gallery Valefar Assimilator Tokens FAQ Q: Can the Nekro Virus use the “Valefar Assimilator” technologies on printed faction units such as the Embers of Muaat’s Prototype War Sun I? A: No, printed faction units are not technologies, and thus are ineligible targets for “Valefar Assimilator.” Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count as ships for the purpose of card effects and fleet supply? A: Infantry that are participating in space combat via “The Alastor” do count as ships (in addition to their own unit type) for the purpose of card effects, but, as a unit that can be transported, they do not count against fleet supply in that system. Q: Can infantry involved in a space combat by using the ability of “The Alastor” flagship be used in an invasion after the space combat? A: Yes. Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship cease participation in combat if the Alastor is destroyed? A: No. Infantry that are committed to the space combat due to the effects of \"The Alastor\" continue to participate until the end of the combat, even if \"The Alastor\" is destroyed. Q: Do infantry involved in a space combat via the effects of “The Alastor” flagship count toward the ships required to use the “Assault Cannon” technology? A: Yes. These infantry may be used to resolve “Assault Cannon.” Q: Does the Winnu “Salai Sai Corian” flagship get additional dice for infantry participating in a fight due to the Nekro “Alastor” flagship? A: Yes. The “Salai Sai Corian” would get one additional die per infantry. Q: Can the Nekro Virus have both a standard and a faction-specific unit upgrade of the same type? A: Yes. Only the faction-specific unit upgrade technology will be in effect, but should the Nekro lose the faction-specific upgrade technology that is being copied by the “Valefar Assimilator,” they would revert to the standard unit upgrade technology that was previously inactive. Q: If the Nekro Virus owns multiple unit upgrade technologies of the same type, such as “Dreadnought II” and “Exotrireme II,” does each one count toward the “Develop Weaponry” and “Revolutionize Warfare” objectives? A: No. Only one upgrade of a given type counts toward those objectives. Q: Can a player who cannot vote (such as the Nekro Virus) play \"rider\" action cards? A: Yes. The Nekro player, or a player who cannot vote due to another effect, can still play \"rider\" action cards. Q: Can the Nekro Virus player play a \"rider\" action card along with their \"Galactic threat\" faction ability? A: Yes, the Nekro Virus may play \"rider\" action cards in addition to using their Galactic threat faction ability for the same agenda. Q: Can the Nekro Virus player play the action cards \"Bribery\" or \"Distinguished Councillor\"? A: No. The Nekro Virus player is unable to vote and so cannot use these cards to gain votes. Q: If the Nekro Virus' Valefar Assimilator technology is copying another player's faction technology and that player is eliminated, does the Valefar Assimilator token remain on that technology? A: Yes. If a player becomes eliminated and the Nekro Virus Valefar Assimilator X or Y token is on one of their faction technologies, that technology remains in play. Q: Can the Nekro Virus score the secret objective \"Adapt New Strategies\"? A: Although Valefar Assimilators themselves do not count, once other faction technologies are copied by them, those faction technologies count for the purpose of this objective. Q: Can the Nekro Virus player use the Prophet's Tears Relic? A: Yes, when the Nekro virus player uses their Propagation faction ability, they could exhaust the Relic to gain an action card. They cannot do this when they GAIN technology via their Technological Singularity faction ability. Q: If the Universities of Jol-Nar player replaces a faction technology with their hero, what happens if the Nekro Virus player had a Valefar Assimilator token on it? A: The token stays on the tech in the tech-deck and Valefar Assimilator still has that technology’s text. Q: Can I use the Nekro Virus’ Agent, Nekro Malleon, or Psychoarchaeology or the Hacan Agent to interrupt another ability since the timing is “during the action phase”? A: No, any ability that is used “during the action phase” cannot be resolved unless there are no other abilities currently being resolved. Q: Are ground forces participating in combat via the Nekro Virus’ Flagship, The Alastor, in the space area? Are they affected by Argent Flight's Strike Wing Alpha II's ability? A: Ground Forces participating in space combat via The Alastor do not move from their origin location. If they were on planets at the start of combat, they stay on the planet, participate in combat, and are immune to SWA2’s ability. If they started in space, they are in space and are subject to SWA2’s ability.

A: Ground Forces participating in space combat via The Alastor do not move from their origin location. If they were on planets at the start of combat, they stay on the planet, participate in combat, and are immune to SWA2’s ability. If they started in space, they are in space and are subject to SWA2’s ability.
